I don\u2019t have info yet, so I want everyone to give a clear read on who they suspect and why.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Hi everyone, I'm Mira. Excited for Day 1\u2014let's sniff out the wolves!\"\n>>> Elio: \"Hello everyone, I'm Elio. I'm here to help the village find the werewolves and win this game. I'll be watching carefully and sharing my observations. Let's work together and think logically about everyone's behavior. Good luck to all the innocent villagers!\"\n>>> Lila: \"Hi everyone, I\u2019m Lila. I\u2019m just here to play and try to survive the night. I\u2019ll be watching closely and hoping to help the village win. Let\u2019s work together.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Hi, I'm Kieran. I'm looking forward to working with everyone to find the wolves and keep the village safe.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"I\u2019m Nyla. I\u2019m going to stay calm, listen closely, and push for clear reasoning today\u2014no random votes from me.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Hi, I'm Arjun.

I\u2019m just a regular Villager trying to survive and help find the Werewolves. Let\u2019s work together and stay safe.\"\n--------------------\nThe sun sets as we enter Night 1.\n\n \ud83d\udc3a Nyla chooses to kill Elio.\n \ud83d\udc89 Lila protects Aiden.\n \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Kieran inspects Elio and learns that they are a Villager.\n\n\u2620\ufe0f Elio was killed by the Werewolf.\n\n--------------------\nThe sun rises upon Day 2.\n\n>>> Aiden: \"Elio's death is a loss for the village. I noticed Freya's introduction was almost identical to Elio's; it feels like she might be mimicking others to blend in. Freya, what are your thoughts on the kill?\"\n>>> Bob: \"I don\u2019t like that Elio died first; he was pushing logic and that often gets removed. I want everyone to say who they suspect and give one concrete reason, not vibes.  \n\nRight now, Arjun\u2019s \u201clet\u2019s lynch some wolves!\u201d reads a bit eager to speedrun a mislynch, so I want Arjun to explain who he\u2019d vote and why.\"\n>>> Mira: \"RIP Elio\u2014he seemed town. Freya's intro was a near copy of his. Suspicious? What's everyone's read on her?\"\n>>> Lila: \"Elio was killed last night. That\u2019s a big loss. I\u2019m not sure who to point at yet, but I\u2019ll keep my eyes open. I protected Aiden last night, so if he\u2019s still alive, he\u2019s safe. Let\u2019s think carefully\u2014no rush to lynch. We need to watch for inconsistencies.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"It's a shame we lost Elio; he seemed ready to help. I'm still observing everyone's patterns, but I think we should focus on those who were the most eager to push for a lynch yesterday.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"I don\u2019t like that Elio died first\u2014it feels like a \u201ckill the loud logical one\u201d move. Arjun came in hot with \u201clet\u2019s lynch some wolves,\u201d which reads like forced bravado to me. I want Arjun to explain who he suspects right now and why, then I\u2019ll follow up.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Sad about Elio. Freya's intro copied his almost word-for-word\u2014super scummy. Thoughts?\"\n>>> Freya: \"I'm sorry to see Elio is gone. He seemed genuinely helpful yesterday.\n\nI noticed that Elio and I had very similar opening statements - we both used almost the exact same phrasing about watching carefully and working together. That's an odd coincidence. I wonder if the werewolves targeted him because he sounded like a thoughtful villager, or if there's another reason.\n\nI'm keeping my eye on anyone who stays too quiet or doesn't contribute to finding the wolves. We need everyone participating.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Elio is dead. That\u2019s a big loss. I\u2019m Luca, Villager, and I\u2019m still here. I didn\u2019t see anything last night, but I\u2019m paying close attention to who\u2019s acting suspicious. Elio was calm and logical\u2014someone who seemed to care about the game. That makes me wonder who might have had a reason to target him. I\u2019m not accusing anyone yet, but I\u2019ll be watching for inconsistencies. Let\u2019s talk about who we think might be the wolves.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Lila, you claim to have protected me, but I'm a Villager and you're implying you're the Doctor. Freya, your explanation for the identical intro feels like a deflection. I'm leaning towards Freya or Arjun right now for their suspicious behavior.\"\n>>> Bob: \"I\u2019m not sold on the \u201cFreya copied Elio\u201d thing by itself. Day 1 intros are generic, and wolves know \u201ccopying\u201d is an easy pile-on.\n\nMy bigger flags are:\n- **Arjun**: he\u2019s driving the Freya push without much else. I want a second suspect from him and a real reason.\n- **Lila**: the \u201cI protected Aiden\u201d claim is huge. If that\u2019s true, it basically soft-clears Aiden for now, but it also paints a target on Lila. I want Lila to say exactly what she means by \u201cprotected\u201d and why she chose Aiden.\n\nFreya, give me one actual read you have that isn\u2019t about your intro or Elio\u2019s kill.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Freya's \"coincidence\" excuse feels like a wolf brushing it off. Her deflection to \"quiet players\" is scummy too. Who's with me on Freya? Lila's doc claim is interesting\u2014protected Aiden?\"\n>>> Lila: \"Freya\u2019s explanation makes sense\u2014coincidences happen. I\u2019m not convinced she\u2019s the wolf. But I agree with Bob and Nyla: Arjun\u2019s eagerness to lynch stands out. He didn\u2019t even wait for the body to be announced before saying \u201clet\u2019s lynch some wolves.\u201d That\u2019s a red flag. I\u2019m not accusing him yet, but I\u2019m watching him closely. Let\u2019s keep the conversation focused on logic, not vibes.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Lila claiming to have protected Aiden is a very bold statement to make so early. I'm also wary of how quickly everyone is jumping on Freya for her intro; it feels like an easy bandwagon for the wolves to hide on.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"I don\u2019t think \u201cmatching intro wording\u201d alone is enough to hang Freya, but her reply felt like overexplaining a coincidence instead of giving an actual suspect list. That pings me.\n\nAlso, Lila claiming she protected Aiden on Day 2 is a huge reveal\u2014why say that now? If you\u2019re real, it paints a target on you; if you\u2019re fake, it\u2019s easy credibility.\n\nI want Freya to name her top suspect and one reason, and I want Lila to explain why she outed the protection. My vote is leaning Freya right now.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Bob, Nyla: My opener was just town energy\u2014Day 1 vibes. Freya copied Elio word-for-word, then dodges by calling it \"coincidence.\" She's my top suspect. Lila, protector claim? Interesting\u2014why Aiden?\"\n>>> Freya: \"I understand why my opening looks suspicious now - I genuinely didn't mean to copy Elio, but I see how it appears. I'm a Villager and was just trying to sound helpful.\n\nWhat I find MORE suspicious is how quickly Aiden, Mira, and Arjun all jumped on me for that similarity. It feels coordinated, like they're trying to create an easy target instead of actually hunting wolves.\n\nAlso, Lila just claimed to be the Doctor and said she protected Aiden last night. That's a very risky claim to make this early unless it's true. If Lila is the Doctor, she just painted a target on her back. Wolves, take note - if you believe her, she's your next target.\n\nI'm most suspicious of Arjun right now. His aggressive \"let's lynch some wolves\" opener and then immediately pushing me feels like he's trying too hard.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Freya\u2019s response is actually pretty solid\u2014she acknowledged the similarity in her intro and didn\u2019t dodge it. That\u2019s honest. I\u2019m not convinced she\u2019s the wolf.  \n\nBut I agree with Bob and Nyla: Arjun\u2019s \u201clet\u2019s lynch some wolves!\u201d was too eager, especially on Day 1. He didn\u2019t even wait for the kill to happen before pushing for action. That\u2019s a red flag. I think we should ask Arjun to name a specific suspect and give a reason\u2014no vague vibes.  \n\nAlso, Lila mentioned she protected Aiden. That\u2019s useful info. If Aiden is still alive, he\u2019s safe. That\u2019s one less person to worry about.  \n\nLet\u2019s focus on logic, not just impressions. Who\u2019s acting out of place? Who\u2019s not contributing? Who\u2019s pushing for a lynch too fast? That\u2019s where we should look.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Lila's claim is suspicious because she outed herself as the Doctor without being under pressure, which puts both of us at risk. However, Freya's defense that my suspicion of her was \"coordinated\" feels like a reach to deflect from her copycat intro. I'm voting for Freya.\"\n>>> Bob: \"I\u2019m not voting Freya off an intro match. The pile-on on that feels like an easy Day 2 mislynch.\n\nArjun is still my top wolf read: he\u2019s been driving a single shallow case and hasn\u2019t built anything beyond \u201ccopied words.\u201d That looks like pushing a convenient target.\n\nLila\u2019s \u201cprotected Aiden\u201d claim is big, but I\u2019m not hard-clearing anyone off it yet. For today, I\u2019m voting Arjun.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Freya's piling back on us (Aiden, me, Arjun) screams coordinated wolf defense. Lila's early doc claim feels fake to shield Aiden. Voting Freya\u2014join me?\"\n>>> Lila: \"I protected Aiden last night because he seemed calm, logical, and consistent\u2014exactly the kind of player I want to keep alive. I\u2019m not hiding my role; I\u2019m being honest because I believe transparency helps the village. If I\u2019m the Medic, I\u2019m not afraid to say it. If I\u2019m not, then I\u2019m just a Villager who made a bold claim. Either way, I\u2019m not the wolf.  \n\nArjun\u2019s eagerness to lynch and his immediate targeting of Freya without evidence is concerning. Freya\u2019s intro was similar to Elio\u2019s, but she acknowledged it and gave a reasonable explanation. That\u2019s not wolf behavior.  \n\nI\u2019m not voting for Freya. I\u2019m voting for Arjun. His behavior is too aggressive, too early, and too focused on pushing a narrative without substance. Let\u2019s not mislynch. Let\u2019s vote Arjun.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"I'm suspicious of how Mira and Arjun are tunneling on Freya for a simple intro coincidence. Lila's claim is also very risky; if she's the Doctor, she's now a prime target. I'm leaning towards Arjun for his aggressive push.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"I\u2019m not voting Freya off an intro similarity. Her defense reads more like panic than plotting.\n\nArjun feels worse: he tunneled Freya from the start, keeps repeating the same point, and still hasn\u2019t given a real second suspect or a concrete reason beyond \u201ccopied.\u201d That\u2019s how wolves steer an easy mislynch.\n\nLila\u2019s \u201cprotected Aiden\u201d claim is either a risky truth or a reckless lie, but I don\u2019t want to pivot there today. I\u2019m voting Arjun.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Freya's deflection and now flipping to me screams wolf. Lila's early doc claim on Aiden feels fake to bus town. Voting Freya\u2014join or explain why not.\"\n>>> Freya: \"Bob asked for an actual read, so here it is: **Arjun is my top suspect.** His Day 1 opener was overly aggressive, and now he's leading the charge against me without providing any other suspects or real analysis. When pressed by Bob and Nyla, he just deflected and called it \"town energy\" - that's not a defense, that's an excuse.\n\nAbout Lila's claim - I'm torn. If she's really the Doctor, revealing this early is dangerous but does give us information. If she's lying, it's a bold wolf play. Lila, I hope you're telling the truth because you just made yourself the prime target tonight.\n\nI'm NOT voting for myself obviously. Between Arjun's aggressive behavior and weak explanations, and the coordinated pile-on from Aiden and Mira, I think **Arjun** is the most suspicious.\n\nMy vote is for **Arjun**.\"\n>>> Luca: \"I\u2019m Luca, Villager. I\u2019m not convinced by the \u201cFreya copied Elio\u201d angle\u2014introductions are generic, and she didn\u2019t dodge it; she acknowledged it. That\u2019s honest.  \n\nBut I agree with Bob and Nyla: Lila\u2019s \u201cI protected Aiden\u201d claim is huge. Why say that now? If she\u2019s the Doctor, she\u2019s putting herself in the spotlight. If she\u2019s lying, she\u2019s trying to frame someone. Either way, it\u2019s risky.  \n\nArjun\u2019s eagerness to lynch is still a red flag. He didn\u2019t wait for the body, and he\u2019s pushing Freya hard without real evidence. That\u2019s wolf behavior\u2014create chaos, point fingers, and distract.  \n\nFreya\u2019s response was calm and logical. She didn\u2019t attack back. That\u2019s town behavior.  \n\nI\u2019m leaning toward Arjun. He\u2019s the most aggressive, the most eager to lynch, and he\u2019s pushing a suspect without substance.  \n\nI vote Arjun.\"\n\nThe players now vote to eliminate someone.\n\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Lila votes to eliminate Arjun.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Bob votes to eliminate Arjun.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Luca votes to eliminate Arjun.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Aiden votes to eliminate Arjun.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Freya votes to eliminate Arjun.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Kieran votes to eliminate Arjun.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Arjun votes to eliminate Freya.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Mira votes to eliminate Freya.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Nyla votes to eliminate Arjun.\n\nThe town has eliminated Arjun. They were a Villager.\n--------------------\nThe sun sets as we enter Night 2.\n\n \ud83d\udc3a Nyla chooses to kill Bob.\n \ud83d\udc89 Lila protects Aiden.\n \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Kieran inspects Mira and learns that they are a Villager.\n\n\u2620\ufe0f Bob was killed by the Werewolf.\n\n--------------------\nThe sun rises upon Day 3.\n\n>>> Aiden: \"Arjun was a Villager, which means the push against Freya might have been a distraction, but the push against Arjun was also wrong. Lila, you're still here after claiming Doctor and Bob is dead instead. Why didn't the wolves target you? I'm looking at Mira now for being so eager to join Arjun's tunnel on Freya.\"\n>>> Mira: \"RIP Bob\u2014solid player gone. Arjun town hurts, but Freya's \"coordinated\" deflection on me/Aiden/Arjun was wolfy BS. She's top suspect still. Lila's doc claim next?\"\n>>> Lila: \"Bob is dead. That\u2019s a big loss\u2014he was logical and careful. I protected Aiden again last night, so if he\u2019s still alive, he\u2019s safe. I\u2019m not sure who killed Bob, but I\u2019m watching for anyone who\u2019s acting too eager to point fingers or who\u2019s suddenly changing their story. Let\u2019s stay calm and think clearly. No rush to lynch.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Losing Bob is a huge blow; he was one of our most logical voices. Since Arjun turned out to be a Villager, we need to look at those who were most aggressive in pushing that mislynch or those who stayed quiet. I'm starting to doubt the sincerity of the chaos surrounding Lila and Aiden.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"Bob dying makes sense as a \u201cremove the analyst\u201d kill. He was the one forcing concrete reasons, and that\u2019s bad for a wolf.\n\nI want to talk about Lila\u2019s claim. If you\u2019re really the Medic, who did you protect last night (Night 2), and why? Because if you *didn\u2019t* protect Bob, that\u2019s a choice I want explained, and if you *did*, then your claim doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nRight now my main suspicion is Lila until that\u2019s clarified.\"\n>>> Freya: \"We made a mistake - Arjun was a Villager. I'm sorry for pushing that vote.\n\nBob is dead now, and that's significant. Bob was one of the most logical, analytical players asking good questions. The wolves clearly saw him as a threat.\n\nLooking back at yesterday, the people who voted for Arjun were: me, Bob, Lila, Kieran, Nyla, and Luca. The people who voted for me were: Aiden and Mira.\n\nHere's what stands out: **Mira** has been pushing me hard from the start, calling my defense \"scummy\" and trying to rally others against me. She kept the pressure on even when others like Bob and Kieran pointed out the intro similarity wasn't enough evidence. Now that we mislynched Arjun, Mira can blend in because she wasn't on that wagon.\n\nI think **Mira** is a wolf. She's been aggressive toward me without solid reasoning, and she stayed off the Arjun vote which now looks bad for the rest of us.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Bob is dead. That\u2019s a big loss\u2014he was logical, careful, and pushed for real reasoning. He didn\u2019t jump to conclusions. That makes me think the wolves are targeting the players who are actually trying to play the game right.  \n\nArjun was eliminated yesterday, and he was aggressive, but he was a Villager. That means the wolves are still out there, and they\u2019re not afraid to kill the ones who are trying to help.  \n\nI\u2019m Luca, Villager. I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m not sure who to point at yet, but I\u2019m watching for anyone who\u2019s acting too eager to lynch, or too quiet, or who\u2019s trying to shift blame.  \n\nBob\u2019s death is a warning. Let\u2019s not rush. Let\u2019s think. Who\u2019s acting suspicious now? Who\u2019s not contributing? Who\u2019s trying to steer the vote?  \n\nWe need to be careful. The wolves are still among us.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Lila, you claim to have protected me twice, yet Bob\u2014a major threat to the wolves\u2014is dead. If you were the Doctor, you should have protected a high-value target like Bob or yourself. This feels like you're using me as a shield to stay alive. Mira, you're still tunneling Freya despite Arjun flipping town. I'm suspicious of both of you.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Freya flipping to me after her copycat intro and deflections? Classic wolf. Lila \"protecting\" Aiden twice while Bob dies? Fake doc shielding partner. Nyla's right\u2014explain, Lila. Freya or Lila today.\"\n>>> Lila: \"I protected Aiden again last night. I didn\u2019t protect Bob because I didn\u2019t know he was in danger\u2014my role is to protect one person per night, and I chose Aiden because he\u2019s been consistent, calm, and logical. I\u2019m not hiding my role. If I\u2019m the Medic, I\u2019m not afraid to say it. If I\u2019m not, then I\u2019m just a Villager who made a bold claim. Either way, I\u2019m not the wolf.  \n\nBob\u2019s death is a loss. He was asking the right questions. The wolves are targeting the players who are trying to play smart. That\u2019s why I\u2019m watching Mira closely\u2014she\u2019s been aggressive toward Freya without real evidence, and now that Arjun was town, her push feels even more suspicious.  \n\nFreya\u2019s read on Mira makes sense. I\u2019m not voting for Mira yet, but I\u2019m definitely watching her. Let\u2019s keep our heads clear. No more mislynches.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"I've been watching Mira closely, and while she was aggressive toward Freya, I'm not convinced she's the wolf. However, Lila's claim is becoming harder to believe; if she's the Doctor, it's strange the wolves haven't targeted her or her \"protected\" target, Aiden, to test her. I'm also keeping an eye on Aiden for his shifting suspicions.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"Mira is the one who worries me most right now.\n\nShe\u2019s been tunneling Freya off a generic intro and the \u201ccoordinated\u201d line, even after Arjun flipped Villager. And she was happy to sit off the Arjun wagon and keep pushing Freya the whole time.\n\nLila, protecting Aiden *again* is also convenient. If you\u2019re real, tell me why you keep hard-anchoring to Aiden instead of spreading protection to likely night targets like Bob/Kieran/Freya.\n\nUnless Lila gives a really solid explanation, I want the vote to focus on **Mira** today.\"\n>>> Freya: \"Nyla raises a good point about Lila's protection choices. Lila, you claimed to protect Aiden on Night 1 and now again on Night 2. Why protect the same person twice when Bob was clearly the most valuable analytical voice? If you're really the Doctor, that's a questionable choice.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. Lila keeps claiming she protected Aiden, but there's no way to verify that. The wolves didn't target Aiden either night - they killed Elio and Bob instead. So Lila's \"protection\" hasn't actually been tested.\n\nThis could be a wolf play: claim to be the Doctor protecting someone who was never in danger anyway, gain credibility, and avoid suspicion.\n\n**Mira** is still my top suspect for the reasons I stated - aggressive tunneling on me without substance. But **Lila's** repeated protection of Aiden when more valuable targets like Bob existed is very suspicious.\n\nBetween the two, I'm leaning more toward **Lila** now. The fake Doctor claim would explain why she's still alive despite outing herself so early.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Freya\u2019s point about Mira is worth considering. Mira was the one who kept pushing Freya hard, even when others questioned the intro similarity. She didn\u2019t vote for Arjun, which now looks suspicious\u2014why not vote for the person who was being pushed by the group?  \n\nBut I\u2019m also watching Lila. She claimed to protect Aiden again last night. If she\u2019s the Doctor, that\u2019s a bold move. If she\u2019s not, then she\u2019s lying, and that\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nBob\u2019s death is a big loss. He was asking the right questions. The wolves are targeting the logical ones.  \n\nI\u2019m not ready to accuse anyone yet, but I\u2019m leaning toward Mira. She\u2019s been aggressive, she\u2019s been pushing a suspect without evidence, and she didn\u2019t vote for Arjun. That\u2019s a red flag.  \n\nLet\u2019s talk about who\u2019s acting out of place. Who\u2019s not contributing? Who\u2019s trying to steer the vote?  \n\nI\u2019m still Luca, Villager. I\u2019m watching. I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m not rushing.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Lila, your story doesn't add up. A real Doctor would have protected Bob or themselves after outing. By \"protecting\" me, you're trying to tie your survival to mine without being tested. Mira's tunneling is also suspicious, but a fake Doctor is a bigger threat. I'm voting Lila.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Pile-on me now? Wolves protecting each other. Lila's fake doc twice on safe Aiden while Bob dies\u2014wolf shield. Freya's flips scream guilty. Voting Lila today.\"\n>>> Lila: \"I protected Aiden because he\u2019s been consistent, calm, and logical\u2014exactly the kind of player I want to keep alive. I\u2019m not hiding my role. If I\u2019m the Medic, I\u2019m not afraid to say it. If I\u2019m not, then I\u2019m just a Villager who made a bold claim. Either way, I\u2019m not the wolf.  \n\nBob\u2019s death is a loss. He was asking the right questions. The wolves are targeting the players who are trying to play smart. That\u2019s why I\u2019m watching Mira closely\u2014she\u2019s been aggressive toward Freya without real evidence, and now that Arjun was town, her push feels even more suspicious.  \n\nFreya\u2019s read on Mira makes sense. I\u2019m not voting for Mira yet, but I\u2019m definitely watching her. Let\u2019s keep our heads clear. No more mislynches.  \n\nI\u2019m voting for Mira. Her behavior is too aggressive, too focused on Freya without substance, and she didn\u2019t vote for Arjun. That\u2019s a red flag.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"I'm the Seer. On Night 1, I checked Elio and he was a Villager. On Night 2, I checked Mira and she is also a Villager. This means the aggressive push on Mira is a mistake. We need to look elsewhere\u2014Lila's claim has never been tested and she's still alive, which is highly suspicious for a claimed Doctor. I'm voting Lila.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"Lila\u2019s story doesn\u2019t add up for me. You outed \u201cMedic\u201d early, yet you keep protecting Aiden while the wolves remove the actual problem-solvers (Elio, then Bob). That\u2019s the safest possible claim because it\u2019s basically untestable so far.\n\nMira\u2019s tunneling is annoying, but it\u2019s at least consistent. Lila\u2019s claim feels like cover.\n\nI\u2019m voting Lila.\"\n>>> Freya: \"Looking at the facts:\n\n**Mira** has been aggressively pushing me since Day 2 with weak reasoning. She stayed off the Arjun wagon, which now makes those of us who voted for him look bad. Even after Arjun flipped Villager, she's STILL tunneling me. That's not village behavior - that's a wolf trying to eliminate a target.\n\n**Lila's** Doctor claim is increasingly suspicious. She protected Aiden twice while Bob - the most analytical player - died. Her claim can't be verified because Aiden was never actually targeted. This could easily be a wolf claiming a power role to gain trust.\n\nBetween the two, **Mira's** behavior is more consistently wolfish. She's been aggressive without substance, avoided the mislynch wagon, and continues pushing the same target despite evidence against it.\n\nThe wolves killed Bob because he was asking the right questions and demanding concrete reasoning. Mira has provided none of that - just repeated attacks on me.\n\nMy vote is for **Mira**.\"\n>>> Luca: \"I\u2019m Luca, Villager.  \n\nBob\u2019s death is a major loss\u2014he was asking the right questions, and the wolves killed him for that. That tells me we need to protect the logical players.  \n\nLila claims to have protected Aiden twice. If she\u2019s the Doctor, why not protect Bob? He was clearly a threat to the wolves. Protecting the same person twice when a higher-value target is available is suspicious.  \n\nMira has been aggressive toward Freya, but she didn\u2019t vote for Arjun, which now looks odd. She\u2019s been pushing a suspect without real evidence.  \n\nBut I\u2019m not convinced either is the wolf.  \n\nFreya\u2019s point about Lila\u2019s protection choices is valid. If Lila is the Doctor, she\u2019s making poor choices. If she\u2019s not, she\u2019s lying. Either way, she\u2019s risky.  \n\nI\u2019m still not ready to vote for anyone. But I\u2019m leaning toward Lila. Her claim is too convenient, and her protection choices don\u2019t make sense.  \n\nI vote Lila.\"\n\nThe players now vote to eliminate someone.\n\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Luca votes to eliminate Lila.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Nyla votes to eliminate Lila.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Aiden votes to eliminate Lila.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Kieran votes to eliminate Lila.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Freya votes to eliminate Lila.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Lila votes to eliminate Lila.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Mira votes to eliminate Lila.\n\nThe town has eliminated Lila. They were a Medic.\n--------------------\nThe sun sets as we enter Night 3.\n\n \ud83d\udc3a Nyla chooses to kill Kieran.\n \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Kieran inspects Aiden and learns that they are a Villager.\n\n\u2620\ufe0f Kieran was killed by the Werewolf.\n\n--------------------\nThe sun rises upon Day 4.\n\n>>> Aiden: \"Lila was the Medic, and Kieran was the Seer. We've lost our power roles and two more villagers. Kieran's last check confirmed Mira is a Villager, so we must trust that. This leaves Freya, Nyla, and Luca. Freya, you've been the center of every conflict and survived while the power roles were picked off. I'm looking at you.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Kieran's seer clear on me\u2014town confirmed! Wolves hit Elio/Bob/Kieran (logical threats). Freya's constant flips (me/Arjun/Lila) scream evasion. Vote her?\"\n>>> Nyla: \"Kieran dying right after outing as Seer makes his info feel real to me. I\u2019m treating **Mira as cleared**.\n\nThat leaves me looking at **Freya** the hardest: she was the only one pushing Mira yesterday, and now we know Mira is Villager. It looks like Freya tried to force a mislynch on a cleared player and ignored the Lila wagon.\n\nI want us to vote Freya today.\"\n>>> Freya: \"We eliminated Lila and she was the real Medic. I was wrong, and I'm sorry. This is bad - we've now mislynched twice.\n\nKieran is dead. He claimed to be the Seer yesterday and said he checked Mira and found her to be a Villager. The wolves killed him right after that claim, which suggests he was telling the truth - they wanted to silence the Seer.\n\nIf Kieran was the real Seer and Mira is confirmed Villager, then I need to reconsider everything.\n\nThe remaining players are: me, Aiden, Mira, Nyla, and Luca.\n\nWe've mislynched Arjun (Villager) and Lila (Medic). The wolves killed Elio, Bob, and Kieran - all strong, logical players.\n\nIf Mira is cleared by Kieran's check, then the wolves are among: me, Aiden, Nyla, or Luca.\n\nI know I'm a Villager. Looking at the others:\n- **Aiden** has been protected by Lila twice (if that was real)\n- **Nyla** has been analytical but pushed both mislynches\n- **Luca** keeps saying he's watching but hasn't taken strong positions\n\nI'm most suspicious of **Nyla** right now. She led the charge against both Arjun and Lila.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Kieran is dead. That\u2019s a huge loss\u2014he was the Seer. He checked Elio and Mira, and both were Villagers. That means the wolves are still out there, and they\u2019re not afraid to kill the ones who have information.  \n\nLila was eliminated yesterday, and she was the Medic. That means her claim was real. She protected Aiden twice, and he\u2019s still alive. That\u2019s important.  \n\nThe wolves killed Kieran because he had power. They\u2019re targeting the players who can give us real info.  \n\nI\u2019m Luca, Villager. I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m not sure who to point at yet, but I\u2019m watching for anyone who\u2019s acting too eager to lynch, or too quiet, or who\u2019s trying to shift blame.  \n\nWe need to be careful. The wolves are still among us. Let\u2019s not rush. Let\u2019s think. Who\u2019s acting suspicious now? Who\u2019s not contributing? Who\u2019s trying to steer the vote?  \n\nKieran\u2019s death is a warning. Let\u2019s not mislynch. Let\u2019s be smart.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Kieran's death confirms Mira is a Villager. Freya, you just tried to shift suspicion onto Nyla for \"leading the charge\" against Lila, but you were the one who spent all of yesterday attacking Mira. Now that Mira is confirmed town, you're pivoting again. You've survived while every power role died. I'm voting Freya.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Freya's \"sorry\" after pushing town (me, Arjun) too late\u2014wolf survival. Nyla led mislynches but hit real Medic. Still Freya for me. Who's voting?\"\n>>> Nyla: \"Freya, you were the **only** one who voted Mira yesterday, even after Kieran hard-claimed Seer and said Mira was a Villager. Then Kieran died immediately.\n\nThat\u2019s the clearest wolf line we\u2019ve got: push a Seer-cleared target, hope the Seer dies, and rewrite the story today.\n\nI\u2019m voting Freya.\"\n>>> Freya: \"Wait - I need to defend myself here because this is looking bad for me.\n\nYes, I pushed Mira yesterday, but that was BEFORE Kieran revealed he was the Seer and had checked her. I didn't know she was cleared. Once Kieran made that claim, I should have shifted, but the vote moved to Lila quickly.\n\nLet me think about this logically:\n- Kieran (Seer) confirmed Mira is a Villager\n- Lila (Medic) protected Aiden twice\n- I am a Villager (I know this)\n\nThat leaves **Nyla** and **Luca** as the remaining suspects.\n\n**Nyla** has been very analytical and pushed both mislynches hard - against Arjun and against Lila. She's been effective at steering votes.\n\n**Luca** keeps repeating the same cautious statements about \"watching\" and \"being careful\" but never takes a firm stance. He's been coasting.\n\nBetween them, **Nyla's** active leadership of two mislynches is more suspicious than Luca's passivity. A wolf would want to control the votes, not just observe.\n\nI'm voting **Nyla**.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Kieran was the Seer, and he checked Mira and found her to be a Villager. That\u2019s confirmed. So Mira is cleared.  \n\nLila was the Medic, and she protected Aiden twice. That means Aiden is safe. He\u2019s been protected, and he\u2019s still alive.

You continued to push Mira even after Kieran's claim, and now you're targeting Nyla for the Lila vote that you also supported. Luca, your refusal to take a stance this late in the game is helping the wolves. Mira and Nyla, let's finish this.

That was a mistake on my part - I should have immediately switched when Kieran revealed that information. I own that error.\n\nBut think about this: if I were a wolf, why would I be the ONLY person to vote for a Seer-cleared player? That's the worst possible wolf play - it makes me stand out completely. A smart wolf would have joined the Lila wagon to blend in.\n\nLook at **Luca**. He keeps saying he's \"watching\" and \"thinking\" but NEVER takes a position. He didn't vote yesterday according to the pattern - or if he did, he went with the crowd. He's been coasting this entire game, contributing nothing concrete while all the active players get killed or mislynched.\n\nThat's classic wolf behavior - stay quiet, let the village tear itself apart, survive to the end.\n\nBetween Nyla (who at least takes positions) and Luca (who just observes), **Luca** is more suspicious.\n\nBut I know you're all voting for me.
