I'm a Villager, and I'm ready to work with everyone to find the wolves. Let's keep a close eye on the discussions today.\"\n>>> Bob: \"I\u2019m Bob. I\u2019m a plain villager, so I\u2019ll be watching how everyone talks and votes today.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Hi, I'm Mira. Excited to play\u2014let's find the wolves!\"\n>>> Elio: \"Hello everyone, I'm Elio. I'm here to help the village find the werewolves and win this game. I'll be watching carefully and sharing my observations. Let's work together and think logically about everyone's behavior. Good luck to all the innocent villagers!\"\n>>> Lila: \"Hi everyone, I\u2019m Lila. I\u2019m just here to play and try to survive the night. I hope we can all work together to figure out who the werewolves are. Let\u2019s stay calm and keep our eyes open.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Hi everyone, I'm Kieran. I'm just a regular villager looking forward to working with you all to find the wolves and keep our town safe.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"I\u2019m Nyla. I\u2019m a villager, and I\u2019m here to watch reactions, ask direct questions, and help us find the wolves fast.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Hi everyone, I'm Arjun. Let's have a good game!\"\n>>> Freya: \"Hello everyone, I'm Freya. I'm here to help the village find the werewolves and win this game. I'll be watching carefully and sharing what I observe. Let's work together to root out the threats among us.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Hi everyone, I\u2019m Luca. I\u2019m just a regular villager here, trying to survive and figure out who the werewolves are. Let\u2019s work together and stay safe.\"\n--------------------\nThe sun sets as we enter Night 1.\n\n \ud83d\udc3a Kieran chooses to kill Nyla.\n \ud83d\udc89 Lila protects Aiden.\n \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Arjun inspects Bob and learns that they are a Villager.\n\n\u2620\ufe0f Nyla was killed by the Werewolf.\n\n--------------------\nThe sun rises upon Day 2.\n\n>>> Aiden: \"Nyla was a strong voice, so the wolves likely wanted her gone early. Elio and Freya\u2019s introductions were almost identical, which feels scripted. I'm suspicious of Elio.\"\n>>> Bob: \"I\u2019m sad Nyla\u2019s gone\u2014she said she\u2019d ask direct questions, so that helps the wolves. I want to hear from everyone: who did you suspect most after Day 1 and why? Also, Elio and Freya both came in with the same \u201cI\u2019ll be watching carefully\u201d vibe\u2014could be nothing, but I want them to give concrete reads today.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Nyla's gone\u2014 she was ready to grill people. Arjun, your intro was the shortest; what do you think happened?\"\n>>> Elio: \"I'm troubled by how closely Freya's introduction mirrored mine - almost word for word. That feels like a werewolf trying to blend in by copying a villager's genuine statement. It's suspicious behavior that we shouldn't ignore. I want to hear what Freya has to say about this.\"\n>>> Lila: \"Nyla was killed last night. That\u2019s a big loss. I\u2019m not sure who to point at yet, but I\u2019ll keep my eyes open. I protected Aiden last night, so he\u2019s safe. Let\u2019s think carefully\u2014maybe someone\u2019s behavior will stand out today. We need to be smart about who we vote out.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"It's a shame to lose Nyla so early; she seemed ready to be very active. I'm curious why the wolves targeted someone so vocal. Elio and Freya's introductions were almost identical\u2014could they be trying to blend in together?\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Nyla's dead\u2014sorry to hear that. I'm the Seer, and I checked Bob last night. He's a villager. Who's looking suspicious to you all?\"\n>>> Freya: \"I'm sorry to see Nyla gone - she seemed ready to ask tough questions. I notice Elio's introduction was very similar to mine, almost like they were copying my approach. That feels calculated. I also find it suspicious that several players used nearly identical phrasing about being \"regular villagers.\" I'm keeping my eye on Elio and Luca.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Nyla is gone. That\u2019s the first death, and it\u2019s a big red flag. I\u2019m a villager, and I\u2019m here to help us find the wolves. I didn\u2019t see anything last night, but I\u2019ll be watching closely today. Everyone, let\u2019s be honest and careful with our words. If anyone acted suspiciously or seemed too eager to point fingers, we should take note. I\u2019m not accusing anyone yet, but I\u2019m keeping my eyes open. Let\u2019s vote wisely.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Lila, you claim you protected me, but I'm a Villager and you didn't say you were the Doctor. Arjun, if you're the Seer, we should trust your read on Bob for now. Elio and Freya are just pointing at each other for the same thing; one of them is likely lying.\"\n>>> Bob: \"I\u2019m glad Arjun says I\u2019m villager. Arjun, tell us your top two suspects right now and why.\n\nLila, you said you protected Aiden\u2014are you saying you\u2019re the bodyguard/doctor? If so, why Aiden on Night 1?\n\nOn the Elio vs Freya thing, it feels like easy bait for wolves. I\u2019m more interested in who\u2019s pushing it the hardest versus giving real reads. Right now Luca\u2019s post feels very generic\u2014Luca, give one concrete suspicion and one person you trust.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Arjun claiming Seer so early? Bold. Who are you checking tonight, and why Bob first? Lila's protector claim feels convenient too.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Wait - I introduced myself first, so how could I have copied Freya? Check the order of introductions. Freya spoke after me, not before. This accusation makes no sense and feels like deflection.\n\nAlso, we now have both Lila claiming to be a protector and Arjun claiming to be the Seer. At least one of them could be lying. Arjun, if you're really the Seer, who are you checking tonight?\"\n>>> Lila: \"Arjun, you\u2019re the Seer? That\u2019s helpful. You checked Bob and he\u2019s a villager\u2014thanks for sharing. I\u2019m not sure who to point at yet, but the copycat introductions between Elio and Freya are definitely worth noting. It\u2019s possible they\u2019re trying to blend in, or maybe they\u2019re just similar players. But with Nyla gone, we need to be careful who we trust. Let\u2019s keep our eyes open and vote based on behavior, not just suspicion.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Lila, you just claimed to have protected Aiden, which means you're claiming to be the Doctor. Arjun, you're claiming Seer and cleared Bob. If both of you are telling the truth, we have a strong foundation. However, Elio and Freya are just pointing fingers at each other for the same thing. I'm leaning towards voting Elio; his reaction to Freya feels more like a deflection.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Lila, claiming protector on day 2 is super early and risky for a real one\u2014feels like a wolf trying to seem useful. Elio and Freya, your intros were identical; one's copying the other to buddy up. Thoughts?\"\n>>> Freya: \"Wait - Lila just claimed she \"protected Aiden last night,\" which means she's claiming to be the Doctor. And Arjun claims he's the Seer who checked Bob. Those are both power roles coming out very early on Day 2. That's risky but could be genuine.\n\nAs for Elio accusing me of copying him - I spoke first! Anyone can check the order. Elio copied MY introduction, then tried to flip it on me. That's classic werewolf deflection. I'm voting for Elio.\"\n>>> Luca: \"I\u2019m Luca, and I\u2019m still a villager. I didn\u2019t protect anyone last night, and I didn\u2019t see anything. I\u2019m not sure why Freya is targeting me\u2014maybe because I said I\u2019d watch behavior, which is what any villager would say. But I\u2019m not copying anyone. I\u2019m just trying to survive. Elio and Freya\u2019s identical lines are weird, but so is Freya accusing me without evidence. Arjun, you\u2019re the Seer\u2014did you check anyone else? We need more info before we vote. Let\u2019s not jump to conclusions.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Lila, you claimed to protect me but didn't confirm you're the Doctor when asked, which is suspicious. However, Elio and Freya are caught in a blatant lie about who spoke first. Elio definitely spoke before Freya. Freya claiming she spoke first is a flat-out lie to the village. I'm voting Freya.\"\n>>> Bob: \"I checked the intro order: Elio spoke before Freya, so Freya saying \u201cI spoke first\u201d is just false. That\u2019s my biggest red flag today.\n\nElio\u2019s point on that is solid, and the Elio-vs-Freya spat looks like Freya trying to flip it. I\u2019m voting Freya.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Freya, you didn't speak first\u2014Elio did, before you. Lying about the order screams wolf. Arjun and Lila's early claims still feel off too. Leaning Elio or Freya.\"\n>>> Elio: \"I need to be clear: I spoke FIRST in the introductions. Go back and check - I'm Elio and I introduced myself before Freya did. Freya is now lying about the order, which is extremely suspicious.\n\nLila claiming Doctor this early is risky and strange. Why protect Aiden specifically on Night 1 with no information?\n\nArjun claiming Seer could be real, but two power roles revealing on Day 2 feels coordinated - possibly wolves trying to control the narrative.\n\nFreya's lie about who spoke first is the most concrete evidence we have. I'm voting Freya.\"\n>>> Lila: \"I\u2019m Lila, and I protected Aiden last night because I wanted to keep someone safe early on\u2014no hidden agenda. I didn\u2019t reveal my role before because I wanted to observe first. Arjun, if you\u2019re the Seer, I trust your read on Bob. As for Elio and Freya, I think they\u2019re both trying to deflect by accusing each other. The timing of their identical statements is suspicious, but I don\u2019t think either is clearly guilty yet. I\u2019m not voting for either of them. I\u2019m leaning toward voting Arjun\u2014his Seer claim came out too early, and he didn\u2019t check anyone else. That\u2019s risky. Let\u2019s be careful who we trust.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Elio, you're right that you spoke first, but the similarity is still too strange to ignore. However, I'm more concerned about Lila. She claimed to protect Aiden but didn't explicitly claim the Doctor role until we pointed it out, and her defense is very vague. I'm torn between the Elio/Freya mess and Lila's risky claim. For now, I'll stick with Elio since that conflict feels most like a wolf trying to stir trouble.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Freya, you didn't speak first\u2014Elio did, before you. Lying about the order screams wolf. Lila, Doctor claim without naming it outright feels fake too. I'm voting Freya.\"\n>>> Freya: \"I need to clarify: I checked the introduction order and Elio is right - he spoke before me. I apologize for that error. However, his immediate attempt to turn that around and accuse me still feels like deflection.\n\nMore importantly, Lila's claim is very suspicious. She said she \"protected Aiden\" but is being vague about her role. A real Doctor wouldn't out themselves this early without good reason. And Arjun claiming Seer on Day 2 is also risky.\n\nI'm most suspicious of Lila right now. Her protection claim feels like a werewolf trying to appear useful. I'm voting for Lila.\"\n>>> Luca: \"I\u2019m Luca, and I\u2019m still just a villager. I didn\u2019t protect anyone, and I didn\u2019t check anyone. I\u2019m not the Seer or the Doctor. I\u2019m not copying anyone\u2014my statement was honest. I\u2019m not sure who to vote for yet, but I\u2019m watching how everyone reacts. Elio and Freya are accusing each other, but both are acting too aggressively. Lila and Arjun are claiming power roles early\u2014maybe they\u2019re telling the truth, maybe not. I\u2019m not ready to vote yet, but I\u2019ll go with the group if we decide on Elio or Freya. Let\u2019s be careful.\"\n\nThe players now vote to eliminate someone.\n\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Lila votes to eliminate Freya.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Luca votes to eliminate Freya.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Bob votes to eliminate Freya.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Kieran votes to eliminate Freya.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Aiden votes to eliminate Freya.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Freya votes to eliminate Lila.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Elio votes to eliminate Freya.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Arjun votes to eliminate Freya.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Mira votes to eliminate Freya.\n\nThe town has eliminated Freya. They were a Villager.\n--------------------\nThe sun sets as we enter Night 2.\n\n \ud83d\udc3a Kieran chooses to kill Arjun.\n \ud83d\udc89 Lila protects Bob.\n \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Arjun inspects Lila and learns that they are a Medic.\n\n\u2620\ufe0f Arjun was killed by the Werewolf.\n\n--------------------\nThe sun rises upon Day 3.\n\n>>> Aiden: \"Arjun was the Seer and he's gone, but he confirmed Bob is a Villager. Freya was innocent, which means Elio's aggressive push against her was a wolf trap. Lila, you still haven't explicitly claimed Doctor despite saying you protected me. I'm looking at Elio and Lila today.\"\n>>> Bob: \"Arjun dying makes me think he was the real Seer, so I\u2019m treating his \u201cBob is villager\u201d as confirmed.\n\nI want answers from Lila: who did you protect on Night 2, and why wasn\u2019t it Arjun after he outed as Seer?\n\nAlso, Kieran, you were one of the only people voting Elio while most of us went Freya\u2014walk me through that.\n\nRight now my top suspicion is Lila, because she pushed Arjun yesterday and her \u201cprotected Aiden\u201d claim still isn\u2019t adding up.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Freya was villager\u2014sorry for that. Arjun killed after Seer claim; probably real, so Bob's clear. Lila's early Doctor still shady. Elio, you hammered Freya hardest.\"\n>>> Elio: \"I'm deeply concerned that we eliminated Freya, who was a Villager. The werewolves then killed Arjun, our claimed Seer, which means we've lost crucial information.\n\nLila's early Doctor claim is looking more suspicious now. She protected Aiden on Night 1 with no reason, then the wolves killed Arjun instead of her - the claimed Doctor. Wolves almost always target the Doctor first if they reveal themselves.\n\nWhy would the wolves leave Lila alive if she's really the Doctor? This suggests Lila might be a werewolf who made a fake claim to appear useful. I'm very suspicious of Lila.\"\n>>> Lila: \"Arjun is gone. That\u2019s a big loss\u2014especially since he claimed to be the Seer. I protected Bob last night, so he\u2019s safe. I\u2019m not sure who to point at yet, but the wolves are targeting power roles. Let\u2019s be careful who we trust. Maybe someone\u2019s behavior will stand out today. We need to think logically and vote wisely.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Arjun was the Seer, so his death confirms he was telling the truth about Bob being a villager. This also makes Lila's claim to be the Doctor much more suspicious, as she didn't protect the one person who could actually find the wolves. I think Lila was trying to fake a power role to blend in.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Arjun is gone. That\u2019s a big loss\u2014especially since he claimed to be the Seer. If he was telling the truth, then the wolves took out a key role early. I\u2019m still Luca, a villager, and I didn\u2019t protect anyone last night. I didn\u2019t check anyone either. I\u2019m not sure who to point at yet, but I\u2019m watching closely. The Elio-Freya thing is still weird, but Freya\u2019s gone now. Maybe we should focus on who\u2019s acting too eager to point fingers or who\u2019s being too vague. Let\u2019s be smart about this.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Lila, you claim to be the Doctor but you didn't protect Arjun, the revealed Seer? That makes no sense for a real Doctor. Plus, you just said you protected Bob, but Arjun already confirmed Bob was a Villager. You're a wolf trying to hide behind fake protections. I'm voting Lila.\"\n>>> Bob: \"If Arjun was the real Seer, the correct Doctor play on Night 2 is protecting Arjun. Lila saying she protected me instead feels like a story you can\u2019t really verify.\n\nAlso, Lila, you keep saying \u201cprotected\u201d but you won\u2019t just clearly own the Doctor claim until pressed. That reads fake to me.\n\nUnless someone has a stronger lead, I\u2019m ready to vote Lila today.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Lila, protecting Bob Night 2 after he was cleared? Didn't save Arjun the Seer. Wolves skipping you screams fake Doctor. Let's vote her.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Lila just said she protected Bob last night - but Bob was already confirmed as a Villager by Arjun. Why would a real Doctor waste protection on someone we already knew was safe instead of protecting Arjun, the Seer?\n\nThis makes no sense. A real Doctor would have protected Arjun after he revealed himself. Lila's claim is falling apart.\n\nAlso, Luca keeps saying \"I didn't protect anyone\" and \"I didn't check anyone\" - no one is asking you that because you never claimed a power role. Why keep repeating it unless you're trying too hard to seem innocent?\n\nI'm voting Lila today. Her Doctor claim doesn't hold up.\"\n>>> Lila: \"I protected Bob last night because I wanted to keep someone safe who had been confirmed as a villager. Arjun was the Seer, and I didn\u2019t protect him because I didn\u2019t know he was the Seer until he said so. I didn\u2019t reveal my role earlier because I wanted to observe first. I\u2019m not lying\u2014my protection claim is real. The wolves killed Arjun, not me, which means they\u2019re targeting power roles, not me. I\u2019m not the wolf. Let\u2019s focus on who\u2019s acting suspiciously now.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Bob, I voted Elio because his argument about the intro order felt like a distraction from the actual roles being claimed. Now that Arjun is dead, we know he was the real Seer. Lila, you claim to have protected Bob last night, but why would you protect someone Arjun already cleared instead of protecting the Seer himself? That makes no sense for a real Doctor. I'm voting Lila.\"\n>>> Luca: \"I\u2019m Luca, and I\u2019m still just a villager. I didn\u2019t protect anyone last night, and I didn\u2019t check anyone. I\u2019m not the Doctor or the Seer. I\u2019m not sure who to vote for yet, but I\u2019m watching how everyone reacts. Lila\u2019s claim is suspicious\u2014she protected Aiden on Night 1, then Bob on Night 2, but didn\u2019t say she was the Doctor until we asked. That\u2019s too vague. Elio\u2019s pushing hard on Lila, but maybe he\u2019s trying to deflect after Freya\u2019s elimination. Let\u2019s be careful. We need more evidence before we vote.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Lila, your defense makes no sense. You said you didn't protect Arjun because you didn't know he was the Seer, but he claimed it on Day 2\u2014before Night 2 happened. You're caught in a lie. You're definitely a wolf. Everyone, let's vote Lila.\"\n>>> Bob: \"Lila\u2019s explanation doesn\u2019t work. Arjun claimed Seer yesterday, so you absolutely knew before Night 2. Protecting me instead of Arjun is the wrong play for a real Doctor.\n\nI\u2019m voting Lila.Lila\"\n>>> Mira: \"Lila, no real Doctor skips protecting the revealed Seer. Fake claim busted. Luca, your repeats are scummy too. Vote Lila.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Lila's defense makes no sense. She says she \"didn't know Arjun was the Seer until he said so\" - but Arjun revealed himself on Day 2, BEFORE Night 2. She had all the information she needed to protect him.\n\nA real Doctor would have protected the revealed Seer. Instead, she claims she protected Bob, someone already confirmed safe. This is a werewolf making up unprovable protection claims.\n\nLuca, you keep volunteering that you \"didn't protect anyone\" when nobody asked. It's suspicious, but Lila's fake Doctor claim is the clearest evidence we have.\n\nI'm voting Lila.\"\n>>> Lila: \"I protected Bob because I wanted to keep a confirmed villager safe. I didn\u2019t protect Arjun because I didn\u2019t know he was the Seer until he said so. I didn\u2019t reveal my role earlier because I wanted to observe first.

Let\u2019s focus on who\u2019s acting suspiciously now.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Lila, your excuse doesn't work. Arjun claimed Seer on Day 2, so you definitely knew his role before Night 2 started. Choosing to protect Bob\u2014who was already safe in the village's eyes\u2014instead of the Seer is a classic wolf mistake when faking a role. You're trying to stay under the radar, but the logic isn't there. I'm voting Lila.\"\n>>> Luca: \"I\u2019m Luca, and I\u2019m still just a villager.

Lila\u2019s claim is suspicious, but I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s the wolf. Maybe she\u2019s just bad at explaining herself. Elio\u2019s been pushing hard on her, but he also pushed Freya, who was innocent. I\u2019m not ready to vote yet, but if the group is set on Lila, I\u2019ll go with it.

They were a Medic.\n--------------------\nThe sun sets as we enter Night 3.\n\n \ud83d\udc3a Kieran chooses to kill Aiden.\n\n\u2620\ufe0f Aiden was killed by the Werewolf.\n\n--------------------\nThe sun rises upon Day 4.\n\n>>> Bob: \"We just mislynched the real Medic, and Aiden got killed for pushing hard. With 5 left, we can\u2019t afford another bad vote.\n\nMy biggest concern is Luca: he\u2019s stayed vague every day, keeps saying \u201cI didn\u2019t protect/check,\u201d and always wants to \u201cgo with the group.\u201d That\u2019s perfect wolf cover.\n\nBefore we vote, I want each of you (Mira, Elio, Kieran, Luca) to name one top suspect and one clear town read, with a reason. I\u2019m currently leaning Luca.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Aiden targeted after nailing Lila's fakeout. Luca, repeating \"didn't protect/check\" unprompted every turn is wolfy overkill. Spill your real reads.\"\n>>> Elio: \"I made a terrible mistake. Lila was the real Medic, and I pushed hard to eliminate her. I'm sorry to the village - I genuinely believed her claim didn't make sense, but I was wrong.\n\nNow Aiden is dead too. We've lost Arjun the Seer, Lila the Medic, and two villagers in Freya and Nyla.\n\nLooking at who's left: Bob was confirmed by Arjun as a Villager. That leaves me, Mira, Kieran, and Luca.\n\nLuca has been extremely suspicious - constantly repeating \"I didn't protect anyone, I didn't check anyone\" when no one asked. It feels like overcompensating. Luca also keeps hedging every statement with \"I'm not sure\" and \"maybe\" - never taking a firm stance.\n\nI believe the werewolf is Luca.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Lila actually was the Medic, which means we made a huge mistake. The wolves must have known she was telling the truth and used our doubt against us. Aiden was a clear villager, so now we're in trouble. I'm looking at Elio\u2014he pushed Freya (a villager) and Lila (the Medic) harder than anyone else. He's been leading the town into traps.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Aiden is gone. That\u2019s a big loss\u2014he was a villager and he was helping us. I\u2019m Luca, still just a villager. I didn\u2019t protect anyone last night, and I didn\u2019t check anyone. I\u2019m not the Doctor or the Seer. I\u2019m not sure who to point at yet, but I\u2019m watching closely. The wolves are targeting key players. Let\u2019s be careful who we trust. Maybe someone\u2019s behavior will stand out today. We need to think logically and vote wisely.\"\n>>> Bob: \"Kieran, if Elio is the wolf, why would he spend all game loudly driving misvotes instead of letting us hang ourselves quietly? That feels more like an overeager villager than a careful wolf.\n\nLuca, you still haven\u2019t given a real suspect or a real town read. \u201cI didn\u2019t protect/check\u201d isn\u2019t a read. Name who you\u2019d vote between Elio and Kieran, and why.\n\nRight now I\u2019m on Luca.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Luca, same vague script again\u2014 \"didn't protect/check,\" \"not sure,\" \"watch closely.\" Wolves love that. Elio pushed town but owned it; you're hiding. Suspect Luca.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Kieran, I pushed Freya because she lied about speaking first - that was concrete evidence. I pushed Lila because her protection choices made no sense. I was wrong about Lila, but my reasoning was logical based on the information we had.\n\nYou, however, have been quietly going along with votes while avoiding taking strong positions until now. Now you're trying to paint me as the problem.\n\nBut look at Luca's statement AGAIN - he just did it AGAIN! \"I didn't protect anyone last night, and I didn't check anyone.\" Nobody asked! No villager talks like this. He's a werewolf trying too hard to sound innocent.\n\nMy top suspect: Luca (constant hedging, repeating unprompted denials)\nMy clear town read: Bob (confirmed by Arjun the Seer)\n\nLuca, answer Bob's question directly: who is YOUR top suspect and why?\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Bob, my top suspect is Elio. He led the charge on both Freya and Lila, and now he's immediately trying to pivot the blame onto Luca for being \"vague.\" It's a classic wolf tactic to lead mislynches and then apologize to look innocent. My clear town read is you, Bob, because Arjun's Seer check is the only thing we can truly rely on. Luca is definitely weird, but Elio is the one actually directing the town's mistakes.\"\n>>> Luca: \"I\u2019m Luca, and I\u2019m still just a villager. I didn\u2019t protect anyone last night, and I didn\u2019t check anyone. I\u2019m not the Doctor or the Seer. I\u2019m not lying\u2014I\u2019m just trying to survive. I\u2019ve been honest every day. Elio is blaming me for being too vague, but I\u2019m not the one who pushed for Lila\u2019s elimination. He was the one who called her out. Kieran, you\u2019re pointing at Elio now, but he was just trying to help. Let\u2019s not turn on each other. We need to be careful.\"\n>>> Bob: \"Luca, you still won\u2019t name a suspect or a town read. You just deflect to \u201cElio pushed Lila.\u201d That\u2019s not solving.\n\nBetween Elio and Kieran, Elio\u2019s been wrong but transparent. Kieran\u2019s case is mostly outcome-based.\n\nI\u2019m voting Luca.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Luca, your copy-paste vagueness every post is wolf hiding in plain sight. Elio's pushes were logical, even if wrong. Vote Luca.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Luca just did it AGAIN - fourth time in a row with the exact same script: \"I didn't protect anyone last night, and I didn't check anyone.\"\n\nThis is not how a villager talks. A real villager doesn't need to constantly deny having power roles that nobody accused them of having. This is a werewolf's tell.\n\nLuca also STILL hasn't answered Bob's direct question: who would you vote between me and Kieran, and why? Instead, he deflects with \"let's not turn on each other.\"\n\nKieran is trying to use my mistakes against me, but wolves hide - they don't lead discussions. I've been wrong, but I've been actively trying to solve the game.\n\nLuca has been passive, vague, and repetitive all game. That's werewolf behavior.\n\nI'm voting Luca.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Bob, I understand your point about Elio, but being \"loud\" is a great way for a wolf to control the narrative, which is exactly what happened with Lila. However, looking at Luca's last response, he completely ignored your request for a suspect and just repeated his script for the fourth time. It's impossible to work with someone who provides zero information. If we're going to win, we have to remove the dead weight. I'll vote with the group on Luca.\"\n>>> Luca: \"I\u2019m Luca, and I\u2019m still just a villager. I didn\u2019t protect anyone last night, and I didn\u2019t check anyone. I\u2019m not the Doctor or the Seer. I\u2019m not lying\u2014I\u2019m just trying to survive. I\u2019ve been honest every day. Elio is blaming me for being too vague, but I\u2019m not the one who pushed for Lila\u2019s elimination. He was the one who called her out. Kieran, you\u2019re pointing at Elio now, but he was just trying to help. Let\u2019s not turn on each other. We need to be careful.\"\n\nThe players now vote to eliminate someone.\n\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Luca votes to eliminate Luca.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Elio votes to eliminate Luca.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Kieran votes to eliminate Luca.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Bob votes to eliminate Luca.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Mira votes to eliminate Luca.\n\nThe town has eliminated Luca. They were a Villager.\n--------------------\nThe sun sets as we enter Night 4.\n\n \ud83d\udc3a Kieran chooses to kill Bob.\n\n\u2620\ufe0f Bob was killed by the Werewolf.\n\n--------------------\nThe sun rises upon Day 5.\n\n>>> Mira: \"Kieran, you've been quiet till now, only flipping to Elio late then group-voting Luca. Elio's been solving (wrong but open). You're the wolf.\"\n>>> Elio: \"We've lost Bob, our confirmed villager. That leaves just me, Mira, and Kieran.\n\nI've been wrong twice - about Lila and Luca. I take responsibility for that. But I've been transparent about my reasoning every step of the way.\n\nLooking back at the game: Kieran has been carefully positioning himself. He voted for me when most voted Freya, then pivoted to accuse me of leading mislynches. He's been playing both sides.\n\nMira has been brief but consistent, and joined the consensus on Lila and Luca.\n\nBetween Mira and Kieran, Kieran's behavior of staying quiet early, then trying to paint me as the wolf for being active, feels like classic werewolf strategy - let the village tear itself apart, then swoop in with accusations.\n\nI believe Kieran is the werewolf.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"It's just the three of us now. Bob was the only confirmed villager, and the wolves took him out to leave us in this mess. Elio, you've led the town to eliminate three villagers in a row\u2014Freya, Lila, and Luca. You've been the architect of every single mistake we've made. Mira, we can't let him win after he's systematically dismantled our village. It has to be Elio.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Kieran, Elio was wrong but led reads; you lurked then outcome-blamed. Wolf move. Elio's town.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Kieran, you're twisting the facts. Yes, I was wrong, but I was actively trying to solve the game based on evidence. You stayed quiet and avoided taking positions until it was safe.\n\nLook at the pattern: You voted for me when the town voted Freya. You only joined the Lila vote after everyone else made the case. You deflected to me on Day 4 instead of helping solve.\n\nA werewolf doesn't need to lead - they just need to survive. You've survived by hiding behind the group and letting villagers fight each other.\n\nMira has been consistent and direct. She's called out suspicious behavior without hedging.\n\nKieran is the werewolf. He's been coasting and now trying to win by blaming the most active villager for the town's mistakes.\n\nI'm voting Kieran.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Mira, Elio is using the \"I'm just an active villager\" excuse to cover for the fact that he has personally eliminated every single person we've lost at the gallows. He's not \"solving\" the game; he's winning it for the wolves by directing our votes. If you vote with him, he wins. Look at his track record\u2014it's 100% wrong. That's not a mistake; it's a strategy. It has to be Elio.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Kieran, lurking then blaming Elio's activity is pure wolf survival. Elio fought openly. Voting Kieran.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Mira, this is it. One of us is right.\n\nKieran's argument is that I've been wrong - that's true. But being wrong as a villager is different from being a werewolf. I've given reasons, taken stances, and tried to solve.\n\nKieran has avoided commitment until forced. He voted me over Freya when the town went Freya. He only joined Lila after the case was made. He's never led a discussion or taken a risk.\n\nA werewolf wins by surviving, not by leading. Kieran has survived by hiding and now blaming the active player.\n\nMy track record is bad, but my behavior is transparent. Kieran's track record is clean because he's avoided taking positions.\n\nTrust the pattern of behavior, not just outcomes. Kieran is the werewolf.\n\nI'm voting Kieran.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Mira, think about the night kills. Nyla, Arjun, Aiden, and Bob were all people who were either confirmed or very vocal. Elio has survived every night despite being the \"leader\" of the town. Why would the wolves leave the person who is supposedly \"solving\" the game alive for five days? Because he's the one doing the killing. He's using his activity as a shield. If you vote me, the game ends and the wolf wins. Don't let Elio's loud voice distract you from his 100% failure rate. It's Elio.\"\n\nThe players now vote to eliminate someone.\n\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Kieran votes to eliminate Elio.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Elio votes to eliminate Kieran.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Mira votes to eliminate Kieran.\n\nThe town has eliminated Kieran.
