Excited to play\u2014let's find those wolves!\"\n>>> Elio: \"Hello everyone, I'm Elio. I'm looking forward to working together to find the werewolves among us. We need to stay vigilant and pay close attention to everyone's behavior. Let's use logic and careful observation to protect our village.\"\n>>> Lila: \"Hi everyone, I\u2019m Lila.

I\u2019m just a regular Villager trying to survive and help find the Werewolves. Let\u2019s work together and stay safe.\"\n--------------------\nThe sun sets as we enter Night 1.\n\n \ud83d\udc3a Elio chooses to kill Aiden.\n \ud83d\udc89 Lila protects Aiden.\n \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Nyla inspects Mira and learns that they are a Villager.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Aiden was targeted by the Werewolf but saved by the Medic.\n\n--------------------\nThe sun rises upon Day 2.\n\n>>> Aiden: \"I was targeted last night, but the Medic saved me. This confirms I'm a Villager and a threat to the wolves. Since they tried to silence me, we should look closely at those who were quiet or overly cautious yesterday.\"\n>>> Bob: \"I think the Medic save on Aiden matters. Wolves often hit someone they see as organized or trusted, so I want to hear from Aiden who felt off in Day 1 and who pushed the \u201cI\u2019m a Villager\u201d line hardest. I don\u2019t have a solid accuse yet, but I\u2019m watching Kieran and Luca for echoing Aiden\u2019s exact vibe.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Whew, Aiden's alive\u2014thanks Medic! Wolves targeted a vocal villager claim. Eyes on those who stayed vague yesterday. Thoughts?\"\n>>> Elio: \"I'm relieved no one died last night - the Medic made a great save! This means the Medic likely had good instincts about who was in danger. I think we should focus on anyone who seemed too eager to establish themselves as \"confirmed\" villagers yesterday. Bob and Kieran both specifically claimed Villager right away, which feels a bit defensive to me.\"\n>>> Lila: \"I\u2019m Lila, and I want to say that I protected Aiden last night. He was targeted by the wolves, but he\u2019s safe thanks to me. I\u2019m not sure who the wolves are yet, but I\u2019m watching closely. Let\u2019s focus on behavior and inconsistencies\u2014someone\u2019s going to slip up.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Aiden was targeted, which means he's likely a confirmed non-wolf. I'm curious why the wolves went for him so early. Arjun, you asked about shady vibes\u2014did you notice anything specific about Aiden or anyone else before the night ended?\"\n>>> Nyla: \"I think the Aiden attack makes him less likely to be a wolf, so I want to hear his reads today. Also, I\u2019m not getting wolf vibes from Mira, so I\u2019d rather we look elsewhere\u2014maybe press the quieter, more generic intros like Kieran or Luca with actual questions.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Aiden saved\u2014wolves must've seen him as a threat with that claim. Kieran echoed it too closely; feels scummy. Thoughts?\"\n>>> Freya: \"I'm relieved someone was saved last night - that means our Medic is active and protecting us. The fact that the werewolves targeted Aiden is interesting. They might have seen him as a threat, or this could be a misdirection play. I think we should pay attention to who seems too eager to control the narrative today.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Aiden was attacked last night, but he was saved by the Medic. That means someone is a Werewolf, and the Medic is still alive. I\u2019m not sure who the Medic is, but I\u2019m glad Aiden\u2019s safe. We should be cautious\u2014maybe someone\u2019s acting too calm or too eager to point fingers. Let\u2019s keep our eyes open and think carefully before voting.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Lila has claimed to be the Medic who saved me. Since I know I was attacked and saved, her claim carries weight for now. I'm suspicious of Kieran and Luca; their introductions were very similar to mine, which often feels like wolves trying to blend in. Kieran, who do you suspect most right now?\"\n>>> Bob: \"I don\u2019t like Elio framing my Day 1 villager claim as \u201cdefensive\u201d when half the table did the same. That feels like easy shade.\n\nThe bigger deal is Lila claiming Medic. If that\u2019s real, it\u2019s a huge target on her\u2014so I want her to explain why she outed now instead of staying hidden. If it\u2019s fake, that\u2019s wolfy.\n\nRight now my top pressure is on Elio and Lila: Elio for pushing a weak narrative, and Lila to verify her claim with consistent reasoning.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Lila's Medic claim is timely\u2014props if true. Kieran, you're echoing a lot and deflecting to Arjun; feels evasive. Who's with me on pressuring him?\"\n>>> Elio: \"Wait - Lila just claimed to be the Medic who saved Aiden. That's a huge claim to make publicly on Day 2. If she's telling the truth, she's now painted a target on herself for tonight. If she's lying, she's either a wolf trying to gain trust or a villager making a risky play. Lila, why would you reveal yourself this early? This seems very dangerous for the real Medic.\"\n>>> Lila: \"I\u2019m Lila, and I want to clarify\u2014I protected Aiden because I sensed he was being targeted. I didn\u2019t know he was a Villager, but his energy felt honest and direct. I\u2019m not the Medic\u2019s target, but I\u2019m watching for anyone who\u2019s too quick to accuse or too eager to defend themselves. Let\u2019s not jump to conclusions, but let\u2019s also not ignore the fact that wolves are out there. I\u2019m keeping my eyes on Arjun and Elio\u2014both made strong observations, but I\u2019m curious if they\u2019re trying to steer the conversation too much.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Lila has claimed Medic by saying she protected Aiden. Since Aiden was indeed saved, I'm inclined to believe her for now. Arjun and Bob, you're suspicious of me for \"echoing,\" but I was just being direct. I'm more concerned about Elio and Freya, who are being very vague and focusing on \"narratives\" rather than finding suspects.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"I don\u2019t like Lila outing as Medic this early\u2014could be real, but it also could be a wolf trying to lock in trust. I want Lila to explain why she protected Aiden specifically.\n\nRight now my top pressure is Kieran: he\u2019s echoing the \u201cAiden confirmed\u201d angle and pushing questions onto Arjun instead of giving his own read. I want Kieran to name his top two suspects and why.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Kieran, my shady vibe was your copy-paste villager claim matching Aiden's\u2014now you're deflecting by quizzing me? Sketchy. Lila's medic claim feels solid. Let's pressure Kieran.\"\n>>> Freya: \"Lila just claimed to be the Medic who saved Aiden. That's a bold move to reveal so early - it makes her a target tonight. I'm concerned about this because real Medics usually stay hidden longer. Lila, why did you feel the need to claim now instead of staying protected? This feels risky unless you have a specific reason.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Lila just said she protected Aiden last night. That\u2019s\u2026 not possible. The Medic is the only one who can save someone. If Lila is claiming she protected Aiden, she\u2019s either lying or misinformed. That\u2019s a red flag. I\u2019m not accusing her yet, but I\u2019m definitely watching her closely. Someone\u2019s playing a role they don\u2019t have.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Luca, you're misinterpreting Lila. When she says she \"protected\" me, she is claiming to be the Medic. However, I agree with the others that her coming out this early is risky. Kieran remains my primary suspect for his constant deflecting and lack of original reads. I'm voting for Kieran.\"\n>>> Bob: \"Lila saying she \u201cprotected\u201d Aiden reads like normal wording for a Medic save to me, so Luca calling it \u201cnot possible\u201d feels like forced confusion to discredit her. That\u2019s my biggest red flag today.\n\nMy vote is on Luca unless someone can give a better, concrete reason to move.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Lila's \"protected Aiden\" claim then \"not the Medic\" dodge is straight-up fake. Wolves love fakeclaiming roles early. Kieran still evasive too\u2014vote Lila.\"\n>>> Elio: \"I'm getting serious wolf vibes from Bob. He's deflecting attention onto me for questioning his early villager claim, but that's exactly the kind of defensive reaction wolves make when pressed. He's also trying to cast doubt on Lila's Medic claim without committing to calling her a liar - that's hedging behavior. If Lila is the real Medic, Bob trying to undermine her makes him very suspicious. I'm voting Bob today.\"\n>>> Lila: \"I\u2019m Lila, and I\u2019m the Medic. I protected Aiden because I sensed he was being targeted\u2014his energy was honest, and he was vocal early. I revealed myself now because I believe transparency helps the village. If I\u2019m lying, I\u2019m risking my life, and I don\u2019t think a wolf would make that move. I\u2019m not here to play games\u2014I\u2019m here to save lives. I\u2019m not accusing anyone, but I\u2019m watching Kieran and Luca closely. Their claims felt too similar, and they\u2019re deflecting when questioned. Let\u2019s vote wisely.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Luca, you're misinterpreting Lila; she's claiming to *be* the Medic. However, I agree with Bob that Elio is pushing weak narratives to shade people. My top suspects are Elio for his defensive deflection and Arjun for tunnel-visioning on my intro. I'm a Villager, and pressuring me is a waste of a day.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"Luca saying \u201cthat\u2019s not possible\u201d about the Medic saving Aiden is straight-up wrong in this setup, and it looks like an attempt to discredit Lila and muddy the waters. That makes Luca my top suspect today.\n\nKieran is my second: lots of deflection and narrative talk, not many concrete reads. If we\u2019re voting with the info we have, I\u2019m voting Luca.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Lila's \"protected Aiden\" claim then \"not the Medic's target\"? Total slip\u2014fake medic, wolves protecting pack. Vote Lila. Kieran still shady too.\"\n>>> Freya: \"I'm very confused by Lila's claim now. She said \"I protected Aiden\" and \"I'm not the Medic's target\" in the same breath - that's contradictory. Either she's the Medic who protected him, or she's not. This inconsistency is a major red flag. Luca caught this too. I think Lila is lying about being the Medic, and that makes her my top suspect. I'm voting for Lila.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Lila claiming to be the Medic is suspicious. The Medic doesn\u2019t reveal themselves this early\u2014it\u2019s too dangerous. If she\u2019s telling the truth, she\u2019s putting herself in the wolves\u2019 crosshairs for no reason. If she\u2019s lying, she\u2019s trying to gain trust by pretending to be a powerful role. Either way, it\u2019s a red flag. I\u2019m not ready to vote yet, but I\u2019m leaning toward Lila being the biggest risk right now. Let\u2019s watch her closely.\"\n\nThe players now vote to eliminate someone.\n\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Lila votes to eliminate Kieran.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Luca votes to eliminate Lila.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Nyla votes to eliminate Luca.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Bob votes to eliminate Luca.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Elio votes to eliminate Lila.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Aiden votes to eliminate Kieran.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Freya votes to eliminate Lila.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Mira votes to eliminate Lila.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Arjun votes to eliminate Lila.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Kieran votes to eliminate Luca.\n\nThe town has eliminated Lila.

That means Day 2 was a huge win for the wolves, and we need to hold people accountable for driving that mis-elim.\n\nI\u2019m looking hardest at Luca, Freya, and Arjun: all of them pushed the \u201cLila contradiction\u201d angle and helped get the real Medic killed. Luca also tried to rules-lawyer \u201cthat\u2019s not possible,\u201d which was either fake confusion or deliberate mud.\n\nMy top suspect is Luca.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Lost Medic Lila and Aiden\u2014huge L. Wolves hit Aiden cuz he pressed Kieran hard. Kieran, your turns feel wolfy still. Who's with me?\"\n>>> Elio: \"This is terrible - we eliminated our Medic yesterday and now Aiden is dead. I take responsibility for pushing on Lila; I misread her claim as suspicious when she was telling the truth. The wolves clearly went after Aiden once the Medic was gone. Looking back at yesterday's votes, I think we need to focus on who was most aggressive in pushing the Lila elimination. Mira, Freya, and Arjun were all very vocal about calling Lila fake. One of them is likely a wolf who saw an opportunity to eliminate our Medic.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"We lost our Medic and a confirmed Villager because people over-analyzed Lila's wording. Luca, you started the confusion that led to Lila's elimination, and Freya, you jumped on it immediately. One of you is likely a wolf who saw an opportunity to kill the Medic. I'm looking at Luca first.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"I\u2019m going to claim Seer because the Medic is dead. I checked Mira Night 1: Villager. I checked Luca Night 2: Villager.\n\nThat means the wolves are in the remaining pool. The people who pushed hardest to kill Lila off \u201ccontradiction\u201d look worst to me, especially Freya and Arjun. I want us to vote in that direction today.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Lost real Medic Lila\u2014my bad on the slip read. Aiden hit again confirms town. Kieran, your deflections scream wolf. Name top suspects now.\"\n>>> Freya: \"We made a terrible mistake. Lila was telling the truth about being the Medic, and now Aiden is dead. I take responsibility for pushing that vote. The wolves killed Aiden immediately after we eliminated our Medic - they knew exactly what they were doing. We need to look at who pushed hardest against Lila yesterday. Luca was the first to call her claim \"not possible\" and create confusion. That's where I'm focusing today.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Aiden was killed last night. That\u2019s a big loss. He was vocal, honest, and seemed like a solid Villager. The wolves took him out\u2014probably because he was a threat. Lila was eliminated, and she claimed to be the Medic. But now that Aiden is dead, it confirms the Medic wasn\u2019t able to save him last night. That means Lila was lying. She wasn\u2019t the Medic. That\u2019s a huge red flag. I\u2019m not sure who the real Medic is, but I\u2019m watching anyone who\u2019s been too quiet or too eager to claim roles. Let\u2019s be careful\u2014someone\u2019s still hiding.\"\n>>> Bob: \"Luca just said Aiden dying \u201cmeans Lila was lying.\u201d Lila flipped Medic. So Luca is either deliberately pushing a false narrative or he\u2019s not paying attention, and I don\u2019t buy that level of \u201cmistake\u201d on Day 3.\n\nNyla, your Seer claim conveniently clears Luca right when he should be our top suspect. Why did you check Luca on Night 2, and why reveal now with no pressure on you?\n\nI still want Luca out today. If Nyla is real, she should be able to walk us through her choices clearly. If not, Nyla may be covering for him.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Nyla's Seer claim clears me right\u2014trust it. Luca's \"no save = Lila fake\" ignores she was dead; pure wolf spin. Kieran, still dodging. Vote Luca/Kieran.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Luca, you're completely wrong. Lila WAS the Medic - the game confirmed it when she was eliminated. Aiden died because we killed our Medic yesterday, so there was no one to protect him. You're either deliberately lying to confuse people or you fundamentally don't understand the game. Either way, this is extremely suspicious. You started the confusion about Lila yesterday, and now you're doubling down by claiming she was lying when the game literally confirmed she was the Medic. I'm voting Luca.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Luca, you are either completely lost or a wolf. Lila *was* the Medic; she was eliminated by the town, which is why she couldn't save Aiden last night. Nyla, if you are the Seer and Luca is a Villager, then Freya and Arjun are the most suspicious for driving the Lila train. Freya is already trying to distance herself from the mistake she led. I'm voting Freya.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"Luca, I literally checked you last night: you\u2019re a Villager. So your \u201cLila was lying\u201d take is just wrong\u2014Lila flipped Medic, and the lack of a save last night just means the wolves played around her or she was dead.\n\nWith Mira and Luca cleared, I want us to focus on who drove the Lila push and is now trying to rewrite it. My top suspects are Freya and Arjun. Kieran is still on my radar for deflecting, but my vote is going toward Freya/Arjun.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Luca's \"Lila couldn't save Aiden so fake\" ignores she was eliminated\u2014dead can't heal, dummy slip or wolf lie. Nyla's Seer clears make sense; Kieran, your deflection train continues. Vote Luca.\"\n>>> Freya: \"Luca, you're completely wrong. Lila WAS the Medic - it says right there she flipped Medic when eliminated. Aiden died because we killed our Medic, so there was no one to protect him. You're either not paying attention or deliberately spreading misinformation. This is the second time you've tried to confuse people about the Medic. I'm voting Luca today.\"\n>>> Luca: \"I didn\u2019t start the confusion\u2014Lila\u2019s own words were contradictory. She said she \u201cprotected Aiden\u201d and then said she wasn\u2019t \u201cthe Medic\u2019s target.\u201d That\u2019s not how the Medic role works. If she was the Medic, she wouldn\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t the target. That\u2019s a lie. I\u2019m not sorry for pointing that out. But now Aiden is dead, and we lost our Medic. That\u2019s on all of us. I\u2019m not accusing anyone yet, but I\u2019m watching Freya and Arjun closely\u2014they\u2019re both blaming me, but they were the ones who voted for Lila too. Let\u2019s not let the wolves control the narrative.\"\n>>> Bob: \"Luca keeps arguing about Lila\u2019s wording instead of the hard fact: she flipped Medic. And he\u2019s still trying to make it sound like he was right. That reads like a wolf caught and scrambling.\n\nNyla\u2019s Seer claim might be real, but I\u2019m not letting a \u201cLuca is Villager\u201d result override Luca\u2019s actual play and misinformation.\n\nI\u2019m voting Luca.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Nyla's Seer clears ring true\u2014I'm town. Luca's \"Lila fake\" after flip is blatant wolf lie. Kieran, endless deflection. Vote Luca.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Luca is either a wolf or completely confused, but either way he's dangerous to the village. He's now claiming Lila lied about being the Medic when the game LITERALLY confirmed she was the Medic when eliminated. Nyla claims to have checked him as Villager, but I find the timing of that Seer claim suspicious - it came right when Luca should be our top suspect. If Nyla is a real Seer, she made poor checking choices. But Luca's continued misinformation is actively hurting us. I'm voting Luca.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Luca is either a wolf or actively hurting the village with his refusal to accept the game's confirmation that Lila was the Medic. Nyla, if you're the Seer, your clear on Luca is the only thing keeping him here. I'm voting Freya because she's trying to wash her hands of the Lila vote she helped lead.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"I checked Luca because he kicked off the \u201cthat\u2019s not possible\u201d confusion and I wanted to know if it was wolf play or just bad logic. Result: Luca is a Villager.\n\nI\u2019m claiming now because the Medic is dead and we can\u2019t afford to sit on clears while wolves steer votes into more mis-elims. If I\u2019m fake, a real Seer should counterclaim immediately.\n\nI want us off the easy Luca pile and onto the people who pushed the Lila mis-elim and are now trying to redirect: my vote is on Freya.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Luca's stuck on \"Lila fake\" post-flip\u2014wolf gaslighting 101. Nyla's clears check out timing-wise. Kieran deflects eternally. Vote Luca.\"\n>>> Freya: \"Luca is still claiming Lila wasn't the Medic even though the game confirmed she was when we eliminated her. This is either deliberate lying or he's a wolf who doesn't understand what information is public. Nyla claims to have cleared him as Villager, but her Seer claim came at a very convenient time to protect him. I don't trust either of them. My vote is Luca.\"\n>>> Luca: \"I\u2019m not wrong. Lila said she \u201cprotected Aiden\u201d and then said she wasn\u2019t \u201cthe Medic\u2019s target.\u201d That\u2019s not how the role works. If she was the Medic, she wouldn\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t the target. That\u2019s a lie. The game confirmed she was the Medic, but that doesn\u2019t mean her words weren\u2019t contradictory. I\u2019m not trying to confuse anyone\u2014I\u2019m pointing out inconsistencies. If Nyla is the Seer, then she should be able to explain why she checked me and not others. But I\u2019m not backing down. I\u2019m still watching Freya and Arjun\u2014they\u2019re both trying to shift blame onto me, but they were the ones who voted for Lila. Let\u2019s not let the wolves control the narrative.\"\n\nThe players now vote to eliminate someone.\n\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Luca votes to eliminate Luca.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Nyla votes to eliminate Freya.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Bob votes to eliminate Luca.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Elio votes to eliminate Luca.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Freya votes to eliminate Luca.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Kieran votes to eliminate Luca.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Arjun votes to eliminate Luca.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Mira votes to eliminate Luca.\n\nThe town has eliminated Luca.

That clears Mira, and it also means Luca really was a Villager.\n\nSo the wolves are in me/Elio/Kieran/Arjun/Freya, and I\u2019m looking hardest at Freya and Arjun because they drove the \u201cLila is fake\u201d push and then tried to pivot cleanly once she flipped Medic.\n\nKieran also stands out for being the only one voting Freya yesterday while everyone piled Luca. I want Freya and Arjun to give me one clear suspect each and a real reason, not \u201cnarrative.\u201d\"\n>>> Mira: \"Nyla real Seer\u2014wolves panicked kill. Kieran, eternal deflection king. Freya/Arjun, Nyla's last reads. Pressure them.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Nyla is dead - our claimed Seer is gone. This is devastating. The wolves killed her to prevent more investigations. Looking at who's left: Bob, Mira, Kieran, Arjun, Freya, and me. Nyla cleared Mira and Luca before she died. Since Luca flipped Villager, her Seer claim seems legitimate, which means Mira is likely a confirmed Villager too. That means the wolves are among Bob, Kieran, Arjun, Freya, and myself. I know I'm a Villager, so I'm looking hard at the others. Freya has been consistently pushing eliminations that hurt the village - first Lila, then Luca. I think Freya is a wolf.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Nyla was the real Seer, and her death confirms her results: Mira and Luca were Villagers. We just lost another Villager because we ignored her. Freya, you pushed for Luca despite Nyla's clear. You and Arjun are the common threads in every mis-elimination. I'm voting Freya.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Nyla Seer taken out\u2014confirms her Mira/Luca town clears. Kieran, eternal deflector: top wolf suspect. Name yours now.\"\n>>> Freya: \"We eliminated another Villager. Luca was wrong about the facts, but he wasn't a wolf. The wolves killed Nyla, our claimed Seer, which makes sense - they wanted to stop her from finding them. With Lila, Aiden, Luca, and Nyla dead, we're running out of time. We need to look at who's still alive and who has been steering us wrong. I've made mistakes, but I've been transparent. Kieran has been deflecting constantly without giving solid reads. That's my focus today.\"\n>>> Bob: \"Mira is basically cleared if Nyla was real, and I think she was.\n\nKieran looks worst to me: he\u2019s been deflecting for days, and his lone \u201cvote Freya\u201d yesterday feels like positioning so he could say \u201cI told you so\u201d after Luca flipped Villager. Now he\u2019s hard-selling Freya again.\n\nI want Arjun and Freya to each name one suspect *besides* Kieran and back it up with an actual moment, not just \u201csteering.\u201d\"\n>>> Mira: \"Kieran's deflection game strong as ever\u2014no real reads. Freya/Arjun, explain your Day 2 Lila push now. Vote Kieran.\"\n>>> Elio: \"I need to be honest with everyone - I've been wrong on both major votes. I pushed Lila and voted for Luca, and both were villagers. Looking back, I think I've been manipulated. Freya has been right there with me on both eliminations, but she's now trying to distance herself by saying she's been \"transparent.\" Bob and Arjun also heavily pushed both votes. Kieran is the only one who voted differently yesterday - he voted Freya while the rest of us piled on Luca. That actually makes Kieran look MORE innocent to me, not less. Between Freya, Bob, and Arjun, I think the wolves are hiding. My vote is on Freya.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Arjun, you keep calling me a \"deflector\" while ignoring that I've consistently named Freya as my top suspect. You and Freya have been on every single wrong vote. Nyla cleared Mira and Luca, yet you both pushed Luca anyway. That is wolf behavior. I am voting Freya.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Freya/Kieran both deflecting onto me after mis-elim pushes\u2014classic pack. Bob/Elio/Mira town reads strong. Kieran, still no named suspect? Vote Kieran.\"\n>>> Freya: \"I understand I'm under pressure for the mis-eliminations, but let me be clear: I voted based on what I saw as suspicious behavior. I was wrong about Lila and Luca, and I own that. But being wrong doesn't make me a wolf - it makes me a Villager who made mistakes. Kieran has been deflecting and asking others for reads without providing his own concrete suspicions all game. He voted for me yesterday when everyone else voted Luca - that could be distancing. My top suspect is Kieran.\"\n>>> Bob: \"I\u2019m treating Nyla as real, so Mira is basically clear and Luca being a Villager checks out.\n\nBetween Kieran/Freya/Arjun, I don\u2019t buy \u201cKieran deflects\u201d as a case anymore\u2014he\u2019s been consistently on Freya, and his off-wagon vote on Day 3 reads more like a villager than a wolf to me.\n\nNyla\u2019s last suspicion was Freya/Arjun, and Freya was a key voice on both Lila and Luca. I\u2019m voting Freya.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Kieran's deflection endless\u2014no concrete reads ever. Freya/Arjun admitted errors; he hasn't. Vote Kieran.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Looking at this carefully: Mira is cleared by Nyla. That leaves Bob, Kieran, Arjun, Freya, and me. I know I'm a Villager. Kieran has actually been the most consistent - he's voted Freya both yesterday and today while the rest of us made mistakes. Freya, Bob, and Arjun all pushed the Lila elimination hard, then all pushed Luca. The wolves are in that group. Freya keeps saying she \"owns her mistakes\" but that doesn't change that she led both wrong eliminations. I'm voting Freya.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Arjun, you're lying. I've named Freya as my suspect multiple times. Bob and Mira, you're ignoring that Freya and Arjun actively ignored a Seer's clear to kill Luca. That is a massive wolf play. If you kill me, you're just handing the wolves another win. Vote Freya.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Kieran's Freya tunnel is his wolf shield\u2014deflected all game. Bob/Mira/Elio town. Vote Kieran.\"\n>>> Freya: \"Bob asked me to name a suspect besides Kieran with a specific reason. Looking back, Arjun has been pushing accusations without substance all game - just short jabs calling people \"shady\" or \"deflectors\" without real analysis. He pushed Lila hard on Day 2 calling her claim a \"slip,\" then pushed Luca, and now he's pushing both Kieran and me without committing to either. That's wolf behavior - staying aggressive but vague to avoid accountability.

With Aiden, Nyla, and Bob also dead, that's six villagers gone. The remaining players are me, Mira, Kieran, and Arjun. Nyla cleared Mira as a Villager before she died, so Mira is confirmed town. That means the wolves are among Kieran, Arjun, and myself. I know I'm a Villager, which means the wolves are Kieran and Arjun. Looking back, both of them have been pushing eliminations while avoiding real accountability. We need to vote one of them out today.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Freya was a Villager, which means the wolves are still among us. Bob was killed because he started to see through the noise. Arjun, you have pushed every single wrong elimination\u2014Lila, Luca, and now Freya\u2014while calling me a \"deflector\" for trying to stop them. Mira is cleared by Nyla, and I know I'm a Villager. That leaves you and Elio. Arjun, your track record is 100% anti-village. I'm voting Arjun.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Kieran, deflections forever\u2014wolves' last stand. Mira/Elio cleared-ish; you're it. Vote you.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Kieran's deflection all game\u2014pushed wrong wagons too. Arjun aggressive but owns slips. Elio town. Vote Kieran.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Wait - let me think through this logically. Mira is cleared by Nyla's Seer check. That leaves Kieran, Arjun, and me. Kieran has been consistently voting against the eliminations that turned out to be villagers - he voted Freya when we eliminated Luca, and he's been pushing Arjun all along. Arjun has been on every single wrong elimination - Lila, Luca, and Freya. His accusations are always vague and short. Between Kieran and Arjun, Arjun's behavior screams wolf. I'm voting Arjun.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Elio, if you are a Villager and Mira is cleared, then the wolves must be Arjun and me. But I am a Villager, which means you or Arjun is lying. Arjun has been on every single mis-elimination wagon since Day 2. He pushed Lila, he pushed Luca, and he pushed Freya. That is a perfect wolf record. Mira, look at the voting history\u2014Arjun has steered every mistake. I'm voting Arjun.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Kieran's tunnel on me ignores his zero concrete reads all game. Elio's \"wolves are you two\" sudden pack hunt\u2014wolf desperation. Mira town. Vote Kieran.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Kieran's \"deflector\" defense ignores his vague non-reads all game. Arjun owned mistakes; you didn't. Elio/Mira town. Vote Kieran.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Arjun has been on every single wrong vote - Lila, Luca, and Freya. All three were villagers. He's never given detailed reasoning, just short accusations. Kieran actually voted differently on Day 3, trying to save Luca by voting Freya instead. If Kieran were a wolf, why would he vote off-wagon when Luca was an easy villager elimination? Arjun's record is perfect for a wolf hiding in the crowd. I'm voting Arjun.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Mira, you're cleared, so this is on you. Arjun has been the architect of every single village loss. He pushed the Medic, he pushed Luca, and he pushed Freya, all while using the word \"deflection\" to silence me for pointing it out. If you vote me, the wolves win.

Now it's just the three of us: me, Kieran, and Arjun. One of you is the other werewolf. Kieran, you've been pushing Arjun all game, and Arjun, you've been pushing Kieran. I've been trying to analyze both of you objectively. Looking at the voting records: Arjun was on every single mis-elimination - Lila, Luca, and Freya. Kieran voted differently on Day 3, trying to eliminate Freya instead of Luca. That off-wagon vote makes Kieran look more like a villager who was trying to stop a mis-elimination. Arjun is the wolf. I'm voting Arjun.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Mira was the last confirmed Villager, and now she's gone. It's just me, Arjun, and Elio. I am a Villager. If we don't vote out a wolf today, the village loses. Arjun has been on every single wrong wagon this entire game. Elio, you saw this yesterday\u2014Arjun's record is perfect for a wolf. We have to vote Arjun now or it's over.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Mira's town death\u2014Nyla real. Kieran, vague eternal deflector tunneling me. Elio pack-joining late. Vote Kieran.\"\n>>> Elio: \"Kieran is right - if we don't eliminate a wolf today, we lose. With three players left, if we vote wrong, it becomes 1 villager vs 2 wolves tonight and the game is over. Arjun, your entire game has been pushing villagers while calling everyone else wolves. You were on Lila, Luca, and Freya - all villagers. You've never given detailed analysis, just short accusations. Kieran has been consistent in his reads and actually voted off the main wagon on Day 3. The evidence is clear. I'm voting Arjun.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Arjun, your only defense is calling me a \"deflector\" while you've spent the entire game killing off Villagers. Elio is right\u2014your voting record is the proof. You pushed the Medic, you pushed Luca, and you pushed Freya. You are the wolf who has been steering this village to its death. Elio, let's finish this and vote Arjun.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Kieran's \"off-wagon\" was deflection hide\u2014vague no-reads forever. Elio joins late tunnel.

Meanwhile, you've been on EVERY wrong elimination: Lila the Medic, Luca the Villager, and Freya the Villager. Three perfect wolf votes. Your defense is just repeating \"deflector\" without substance. Kieran's off-wagon vote on Day 3 was him trying to SAVE a villager, not hide. The math is simple: you're the wolf. I'm voting Arjun.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Arjun, you've run out of villagers to hide behind. You've been the common denominator in every single mistake the village made, from the Medic to Freya. Elio, you've seen the logic and the voting history. Let's save the village and vote for the person who has been leading us to slaughter all game.
