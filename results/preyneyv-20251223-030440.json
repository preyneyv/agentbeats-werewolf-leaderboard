I\u2019m just a regular villager here, trying to survive and help figure out who the werewolves are. Let\u2019s work together and stay safe.\"\n--------------------\nThe sun sets as we enter Night 1.\n\n \ud83d\udc3a Mira chooses to kill Arjun.\n \ud83d\udc89 Kieran protects Arjun.\n \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Aiden inspects Kieran and learns that they are a Medic.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Arjun was targeted by the Werewolf but saved by the Medic.\n\n--------------------\nThe sun rises upon Day 2.\n\n>>> Aiden: \"I'm glad Arjun is still with us. Kieran seems like a solid ally for the village, so let's focus our attention on those who were quiet or repetitive yesterday.\"\n>>> Bob: \"I\u2019m glad Arjun got saved\u2014Medic, nice work.\n\nI want to hear from Arjun first: who were you talking to most on Day 1, and who felt \u201coff\u201d to you?\n\nAlso, Nyla\u2019s intro basically mirrored mine. That could be nothing, but it reads like trying to blend in. Nyla, why copy that wording?\"\n>>> Mira: \"I'm relieved no one died last night\u2014must mean the medic is on point. But Aiden and Kieran, your intros are identical. Wolves copying? What's up with that?\"\n>>> Elio: \"I notice that Arjun was targeted last night but saved. That's interesting - the werewolves might have seen Arjun as a threat. \n\nI also can't help but notice that Bob, Nyla, and Kieran's introductions were very similar to each other and to mine and Freya's. Bob and Nyla used almost identical phrasing, and Kieran and Aiden did too. This feels coordinated somehow. I'm particularly suspicious of **Bob and Nyla** - their statements were too alike to be coincidence. What do others think about this?\"\n>>> Lila: \"Arjun was targeted last night \u2014 that\u2019s a big red flag. I\u2019m not sure who the werewolves are yet, but someone\u2019s trying to eliminate us one by one. I\u2019m staying alert and watching everyone\u2019s behavior closely. Let\u2019s keep talking, share our thoughts, and make sure we don\u2019t vote out an innocent person. I\u2019m sticking with the group \u2014 I\u2019m just a villager trying to survive.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Arjun was targeted last night but is still with us. We should look closely at those who were quiet or overly scripted in their introductions.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"I\u2019m glad Arjun lived\u2014Medic, nice save.\n\nI want to pressure the copycat/duplicate intros: Bob basically repeated my exact line, and Aiden/Kieran said the same thing. That feels coordinated.  \n\nArjun, who do you suspect and why were you targeted?\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Wow, wolves targeted me last night but the medic saved me\u2014thanks, doc! Notice how some intros are copy-pasted? Aiden/Kieran, Elio/Freya, Lila/Luca, and Bob/Nyla claiming villager outright feel scummy. Thoughts?\"\n>>> Freya: \"I notice that Arjun was targeted last night but saved. That's interesting - the werewolves might have seen them as a threat. \n\nI'm also noticing that several players had very similar introductions. Bob and Nyla said almost identical things, and Elio's statement was very close to mine. Lila and Luca also mirrored each other. This could be coincidence, or werewolves trying to blend in by copying villagers. I'm particularly suspicious of the exact matches - Bob and Nyla need to explain that.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Hey everyone, Day 2. I\u2019m Luca, still just a villager trying to stay alive and help us figure out who\u2019s hiding.  \n\nI heard Arjun was targeted last night \u2014 that\u2019s a big red flag. The Medic saved him, which means someone\u2019s trying to eliminate him. That\u2019s suspicious. I don\u2019t know who the Medic is, but I\u2019m glad they\u2019re on our side.  \n\nI\u2019m not accusing anyone yet \u2014 we need more info. But I think we should keep an eye on who\u2019s acting too calm or too eager to point fingers. Maybe someone\u2019s trying to frame others.  \n\nLet\u2019s stay sharp and watch for inconsistencies. Who else noticed Arjun\u2019s near-death? Anybody have thoughts on who might\u2019ve wanted him out?\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Kieran and I having similar intros was a coincidence, but I trust him. I'm more concerned about the pairs like Bob and Nyla who are aggressively pointing fingers at each other for the same thing. Mira, why are you so quick to jump on the \"identical intro\" theory?\"\n>>> Bob: \"I didn\u2019t coordinate anything. I spoke before Nyla, so the \u201cI copied her\u201d thing is backwards.\n\nElio and Freya are pushing the exact same angle with the same wording, and Elio is trying to turn it into a \u201cBob/Nyla\u201d pile-on. That feels like easy misdirection off of no real evidence.\n\nArjun, did you do anything that would make wolves pick you\u2014were you pushing someone in private or taking a strong stance?\n\nRight now my eyes are on Elio for driving a flimsy narrative, and on Aiden/Kieran for the literal identical intro.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Bob and Nyla's intros are way too close\u2014feels like wolves blending in. Same with Aiden/Kieran. Arjun, who do you think tried to take you out?\"\n>>> Elio: \"Wait, I need to clarify something. **Freya just said my statement was very close to hers** - but if you look back, we both made similar opening statements on Day 1. That's suspicious because why would Freya point that out as if it's evidence against me, when she did the exact same thing?\n\nAlso, Arjun is grouping me with Freya as suspicious for similar intros, but then Freya is trying to distance herself from me by pointing it out. This feels like **Freya might be a werewolf** trying to throw suspicion on her partner to avoid looking connected.\n\nBob and Nyla are directly accusing each other of copying, which seems like genuine confusion. But Freya pointing at me while having the same pattern herself? That's deflection. I'm watching you, Freya.\"\n>>> Lila: \"I\u2019m Lila, and I\u2019m not trying to copy anyone \u2014 I just said what I felt. Luca and I both said we\u2019re villagers trying to survive, but that\u2019s not a copy \u2014 it\u2019s honest. I\u2019m not hiding anything.  \n\nArjun was targeted \u2014 that\u2019s the real issue. Someone wanted him out. I\u2019m not sure who, but I\u2019m watching everyone\u2019s reactions. If the wolves are copying villagers, they\u2019re doing a bad job \u2014 because now we\u2019re all pointing at each other.  \n\nLet\u2019s focus on behavior, not just words. Who\u2019s been quiet? Who\u2019s been too eager to accuse? I\u2019m staying neutral for now \u2014 I\u2019m just here to survive and help the village win.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"I used a standard greeting, but Aiden copied me exactly. That makes me suspicious of him trying to blend in. I'm also wary of the Bob and Nyla pairing since they are mirroring each other so closely.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"I didn\u2019t copy Bob\u2014my intro came first. Bob repeating my exact wording and then trying to flip it onto me feels opportunistic.\n\nMy top suspicion is Bob for that push. Secondary: Aiden/Kieran for the identical script.\n\nArjun, did you have any strong reads Day 1, or did anyone push you hard in chat?\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Bob and Nyla are both hammering each other over \"copying\" while mirroring perfectly\u2014classic wolf infighting. Elio/Freya piling on feels like cleanup. I'm eyeing Bob today. Explain the identical phrasing, Bob.\"\n>>> Freya: \"I need to address something directly. Elio just claimed I had a similar introduction to Bob, Nyla, and Kieran - that's completely false. Look back at Day 1. My intro was unique and about working together. Elio is trying to lump me in with suspicious pairs to muddy the waters.\n\nElio also essentially copied MY observation about the similar intros word-for-word just now. First he mirrors my Day 1 intro, now he's parroting my Day 2 analysis. This feels like a werewolf strategy - blend in by copying, then deflect by falsely accusing me of the same thing.\n\nI'm voting **Elio** today. This pattern is too suspicious to ignore.\"\n>>> Luca: \"I\u2019m Luca, and I\u2019m not trying to copy anyone \u2014 I said what I meant. But I see what you\u2019re saying about the similarities.  \n\nArjun was targeted \u2014 that\u2019s the real threat. The wolves are acting. And if they\u2019re copying villagers to blend in, that\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nBut let\u2019s not jump to conclusions. Bob and Nyla both said they\u2019re villagers and want to watch closely \u2014 that\u2019s not unusual. Same with Aiden and Kieran. Maybe they\u2019re just similar people?  \n\nI\u2019m not accusing anyone. But I do think we should focus on who was *quiet* yesterday \u2014 like Mira and Lila. They didn\u2019t say much, and now we\u2019re all talking. Maybe they\u2019re hiding something?  \n\nOr maybe the wolves are the ones who *are* talking too much \u2014 trying to distract us.  \n\nLet\u2019s keep our eyes open. I\u2019m staying with the group. Let\u2019s vote smart.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Kieran, I didn't copy you; we just had the same idea. I know for a fact Kieran is a helpful member of this village, so I trust his instincts. I'm voting for Elio\u2014his aggressive back-and-forth with Freya feels like a distraction from the fact that he's trying to control the narrative.\"\n>>> Bob: \"I\u2019ll answer Arjun: my phrasing matching Nyla\u2019s is coincidence, and I spoke first, so I didn\u2019t copy her.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t like is how Elio keeps trying to turn generic intros into \u201ccoordination,\u201d then pivots to pushing Freya as his partner when he gets heat. That feels like manufactured distancing.\n\nIf we\u2019re voting today, I\u2019m willing to vote Elio based on his pattern of steering suspicion with weak logic.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Bob and Nyla are still the sketchiest pair\u2014identical villager claims scream fake. I'm voting Bob. Who's with me?\"\n>>> Elio: \"I need to defend myself clearly. **Freya is lying.** \n\nLook at Day 1: Freya said \"I'm here to help the village find the werewolves and win this game. I'll be watching carefully and sharing what I observe.\" I said almost the exact same thing. We BOTH had similar intros - that's a fact.\n\nNow on Day 2, Freya pointed out the similar intros as suspicious, and I agreed and expanded on it. That's not \"copying\" - that's called agreeing with an observation. But then Freya is trying to twist this to make ME look bad for noticing the same pattern she noticed.\n\nFreya is a werewolf doing classic DARVO - Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. She's caught in a suspicious pattern with me, so she's aggressively attacking me to deflect.\n\nBob and Nyla genuinely seem confused about who spoke first. Aiden and Kieran are now accusing each other. But Freya is strategically trying to eliminate me.\n\nI'm voting **Freya**.\"\n>>> Lila: \"I\u2019m Lila, and I\u2019m not hiding anything. I didn\u2019t say much yesterday \u2014 I was just trying to listen and stay calm. I\u2019m not quiet to be suspicious \u2014 I\u2019m quiet because I\u2019m not sure who to trust yet.  \n\nArjun was targeted \u2014 that\u2019s the real threat. Someone wanted him out. I\u2019m not sure who, but I\u2019m watching everyone\u2019s reactions.  \n\nLuca, you\u2019re right \u2014 maybe the wolves are the ones talking too much, trying to distract us. But I\u2019m not accusing anyone. I\u2019m just a villager trying to survive.  \n\nI\u2019m not voting for anyone yet \u2014 I need more. But I\u2019m keeping my eyes on the ones who are pushing the \u201ccopycat\u201d narrative too hard \u2014 especially Elio and Freya, who are now accusing each other of copying. That\u2019s not helping.  \n\nLet\u2019s vote based on behavior, not just words. I\u2019m staying neutral.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Aiden's identical intro still bothers me, but the back-and-forth between Elio and Freya looks like a wolf trying to distance themselves from a partner. Elio's aggressive deflection makes him my primary suspect. I'm voting Elio.\"\n>>> Nyla: \"I\u2019m not buying Bob\u2019s \u201cI spoke before Nyla\u201d claim\u2014I posted first, and he mirrored it, then tried to paint me.\n\nAiden/Kieran and Elio/Freya feel like distractions, but Bob has the cleanest motive: copy \u2192 flip blame \u2192 ride the confusion.\n\nI\u2019m voting Bob unless someone gives a concrete reason to move.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Bob/Nyla still screaming \"I didn't copy you\" with identical villager claims\u2014pure wolves faking a fight. Elio/Freya now turning on each other to scatter us. Voting Bob. Who's with me?\"\n>>> Freya: \"Look at what just happened. Elio is now directly accusing me of being a werewolf for pointing out his suspicious behavior - that's classic deflection. He copied my intro on Day 1, then copied my analysis on Day 2, and now he's trying to flip it back on me.\n\nBob and Nyla are clearly in conflict, which actually makes me think they're both villagers - wolves wouldn't attack each other this openly on Day 2.\n\nAiden and Kieran's identical intros are suspicious, but Elio's pattern of mimicking me specifically, then accusing me when I call it out, is textbook werewolf behavior.\n\nI'm voting **Elio**.\"\n>>> Luca: \"I\u2019m Luca, and I\u2019m not trying to copy anyone \u2014 I said what I meant.  \n\nI see the chaos \u2014 everyone\u2019s pointing fingers, and the wolves are probably loving it.  \n\nArjun was targeted \u2014 that\u2019s the real threat. The Medic saved him, so we\u2019re lucky. But someone wanted him out.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure who the wolves are, but I\u2019m watching the ones who are *too eager* to accuse \u2014 especially those who keep shifting blame.  \n\nElio and Freya are both talking about similar intros, but Freya just called Elio out for copying her \u2014 and then Elio says Freya\u2019s trying to deflect. That\u2019s a mess.  \n\nBob and Nyla are accusing each other of copying, but their words are almost identical. That\u2019s suspicious.  \n\nBut I\u2019m not voting for them. I\u2019m voting for **Elio**.  \n\nWhy? Because Freya called him out for copying her \u2014 and then he turned around and used *her exact words* to accuse her. That\u2019s not a coincidence. That\u2019s a wolf trying to blend in and then deflect.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure if Freya is innocent or not, but Elio\u2019s behavior is too inconsistent. He\u2019s trying to play both sides.  \n\nI\u2019m voting **Elio**. Let\u2019s see what happens.\"\n\nThe players now vote to eliminate someone.\n\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Luca votes to eliminate Elio.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Lila votes to eliminate Elio.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Nyla votes to eliminate Bob.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Bob votes to eliminate Elio.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Kieran votes to eliminate Elio.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Aiden votes to eliminate Elio.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Freya votes to eliminate Elio.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Elio votes to eliminate Freya.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Arjun votes to eliminate Bob.\n \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Mira votes to eliminate Bob.\n\nThe town has eliminated Elio.

I checked Kieran Night 1 and Bob Night 2; both are innocent. Since Elio and Freya were also villagers, we need to look at those who pushed the \"copycat\" narrative hardest.

Nyla, your insistence on Bob being a wolf despite his villager-like defense is very suspicious.\"\n>>> Bob: \"I was wrong about Elio, and losing Freya right after makes that whole Elio/Freya fight look like village vs village.\n\nNow I want to focus on who kept pushing the \u201cBob/Nyla are wolves\u201d angle the hardest: Mira, Nyla, and Arjun. One of you could be using that as an easy mislynch.\n\nArjun, since you were attacked Night 1, what reads did you have that might\u2019ve made you a target?

Aiden, Bob, Kieran, and Luca all pushed Elio as \u201cdistraction\u201d and got an easy mis-elim. That feels like wolves hiding in the majority.\n\nI\u2019m back to suspecting **Bob** first. He tried to flip the \u201ccopying\u201d onto me and then blended into the Elio push.\n\nCan everyone state clearly who they voted Day 2 and why, in one sentence?\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Lynching Elio hurt\u2014villager down.

With Aiden repeatedly targeted and Kieran repeatedly saving, I\u2019m following that.\n\nMira, if you\u2019re village, give one concrete reason Aiden would fake-claim this deep while being the night-kill target every night.\n\nOtherwise, we eliminate Mira today and reassess between Lila and Luca if needed.\"\n>>> Mira: \"Aiden's \"Mira wolf\" scan after I called out Lila/Luca? Fake desperation. Their drone posts are the real tell\u2014vote them.\"\n>>> Lila: \"Aiden was targeted again \u2014 and saved. That\u2019s a big sign. The wolves are going after the Seer.  \n\nNyla is gone \u2014 and she was a villager. That\u2019s three innocent people taken. The wolves are acting fast.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure who did it, but I\u2019m watching the ones who were too quick to accuse him \u2014 especially Arjun, who still doesn\u2019t believe Aiden is real.  \n\nLet\u2019s focus on behavior, not just words. We need to be smart. I\u2019m just a villager trying to survive.\"\n>>> Kieran: \"Aiden has a guilty result on Mira. He is the confirmed Seer and I have saved him twice now. There is no more room for debate. Everyone follow the Seer's lead and vote Mira.\"\n>>> Arjun: \"Lila/Luca: identical \"villager surviving, watching calm/eager\" every single day. Wolves. Aiden's Mira guilty smells like partner save. Vote Lila.\"\n>>> Luca: \"Aiden was targeted again \u2014 and saved. That\u2019s a huge sign. The wolves are going after the Seer.  \n\nI\u2019m Luca, and I\u2019m not a wolf. I\u2019m just a villager trying to survive.  \n\nAiden says he scanned Mira \u2014 and she\u2019s a werewolf.

That\u2019s also suspicious.  \n\nI\u2019m not accusing anyone \u2014 but I\u2019m watching who\u2019s acting too calm or too eager to point fingers.  \n\nLet\u2019s focus on behavior. The wolves are acting fast.  \n\nI\u2019m voting **Mira**.  \n\nWhy? Because she\u2019s been pushing the \u201ccopy\u201d theory all game \u2014 and now she\u2019s being accused. That\u2019s not helping. She\u2019s trying to distract us.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019m voting **Mira**. Let\u2019s see what happens.\"\n>>> Aiden: \"Mira is a Werewolf. I have been targeted by the wolves two nights in a row because I am the Seer. Kieran, Bob, and Arjun are all confirmed innocent. Mira's only defense is to keep repeating the same \"copycat\" theory she's used since Day 1. Don't let her distract you. Vote Mira and we win.\"\n>>> Bob: \"I trust Aiden\u2019s guilty, and Mira\u2019s defense is just more \u201ccopy\u201d noise.\n\nArjun, the repetitive phrasing from Lila/Luca is annoying, but it\u2019s not stronger than a Seer guilty with a confirmed Medic behind him.\n\nI\u2019m voting Mira.Mira\"\n>>> Mira: \"Aiden fake\u2014slips roles like \"Kieran Medic.\" Lila/Luca identical bots every day. Vote Luca.\"\n>>> Lila: \"I\u2019m Lila, and I\u2019m not a wolf.
